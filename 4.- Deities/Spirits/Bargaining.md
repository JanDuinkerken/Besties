#Deities/Spirits
# "The Bargaining"
 A corrupted [[Spirits|spirit]] that terrorized [[Willowfey]], eventually put to rest by [[January]] and [[Varian]] some time ago.  
A statue was made in their honor... per [[January]]'s request.

Many [[Fey]] can recall the [[Spirits|Spirit]] and the events that took place. Characters like [[Gillian]], Grandmew, and Emie, all have their own personal experiences with the [[Spirits|spirit]].
