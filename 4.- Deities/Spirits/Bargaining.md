# "The Bargaining"
 A corrupted spirit that terrorized Willowfey, eventually put to rest by January and Varian some time ago.  
A statue was made in their honor... per January's request.

Many Fey can recall the Spirit and the events that took place. Characters like Gillian, Grandmew, and Emie, all have their own personal experiences with the spirit.
