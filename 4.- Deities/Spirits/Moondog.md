#Deities/Spirits
# "Moondog"
[[Maggie]]'s unintentional creation, due to their belief in the moon.

Like many [[spirits]], this one has gone by many names, not claiming any sort of name for themself. Some of these include "The Ivory [[Spirits|spirit]]," "The Beast," or "The Giver of Faces."

They are peaceful and uncorrupted, drifting aimlessly across [[Halune]] bringing gentle storms and winds. They aid those who wish to start their lives anew by granting them a "new face." This gives the user a second chance; an opportunity to accept/reconcile with their faults and start over their lives with a clean slate.
