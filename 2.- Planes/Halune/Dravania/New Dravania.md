[[Halune]]
# New Dravania
One of the three parts of [[Dravania]].

This land was inhabited by [[elezen]] and "ruled" by the [[Archbishop]]. They had a very strong believe in [[Ravan]], to the point of killing those who they deemed heretics.

The [[Archbishop]] had declared a war with the [[giants]] because they were not happy with them drinking the blood of [[Ravan]].

It turns out the [[Archbishop]] was restraining and weakening [[Ravan]] to extract his blood, and then he was giving it to his followers to transform them into draconic beings to later harness their power and become the new god.

The [[0.- Besties|besties]] found out about this and stopped him with the help of the [[giants]], killing him and letting [[Levi]] become [[Ravan]]'s succesor.

After this the [[giants]] moved in and helped in rebuilding the city, which had been destroyed in the fight against [[Ravan]].

New Dravania is now ruled by [[Levi]] and his council, there are still problems because the [[elezen]] are not fond of the [[giants]].
