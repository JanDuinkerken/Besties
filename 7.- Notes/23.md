-   Ok so learning about government things ft [[clarissa]] and [[Giddyan|giddy]]
    

-   Lord commander
    
-   Needs others to see for him
    
-   These books are all past records
    
-   Big Important Book of History Very Ornate portrait of a man (the [[archbishop]], ser Bastion me thinks) (basically how [[dravania]] is founded)
    

-   How did you escape? Don't like to talk about it
    
-   Ok magggie [[Venneer|veneer]] and [[lemm]] go sneaking
    

-   How to see everything works
    
-   Lots of artwork and history on the walls, everywhere, [[5.- Artifacts|relics]] arent presented to the public¬†
    
-   As we go statues begin to look more saint-like, statue of Sir Ryu, next to it an empty space, waiting¬†
    
-   Multiple paintings of people perfecting the art of hunting dragons, specialized knights (dragoons) that leap into the sky and strike down the dragons, then they take em and there‚Äôs Mr Eye Eater eating eyes again, giving more power, [[giants]] come from [[the Highlands]] and dont like this, big war lmfao, luckily the [[elezen]] won!!!! Everything got nice!!!! Everything is lovely and perfect, no dragons and we got an [[archbishop]]!!!! Next to the painting of the [[archbishop]] there's presumably a saint and a table of knights
    
-   Everyone who‚Äôs got a statue is dead, 2 statues look similar to how [[Ravan]] shifted in that room, Sir Ryu and other that looks more motherly (saint before Ryu), one statue looks familiar to the one standing beside the [[archbishop]], hard to gather with no context
    
-   [[Lemm]] is doing dream nail (??) at the painting with the dragoon Knights. He looks out into a field of ruins and dead [[fey]]/immortal beings, eyes gouged out
    
-   ![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/6qFc-_bFwWiptdnuK8fwpx7OJPQgdwW3-ygNXLpqQ2BU3NtjW96z8jl82AeoHdkjNtWKXCcH6P-m3pQ9gKW60tUJ3z_1L73zvyY42kHrE9AFi7_MiNkPzOM7OARR4QbtaqCwdwdSqso2Egx8nQ)
    
-   , presumably dead, the knights follow the leader's (Sir Bastian) steps, He's standing on a dead [[dragon]] with an eye on their hand. The [[dragon]] makes a pact with Ser Bastion to become a [[Gods|god]] and have a religion and all of that¬†
    

  

-   Ser Ryu statue check:
    

-   Ryu was very well known for funding the modernized military and the scholarly system, made a lot of changes, he was [[Levi]]‚Äôs older brother when he was younger and alive, who‚Äôd wanna be jealous of a saint destined to die by the hands of the [[archbishop]]. Ravans crystal placed in the saint, then [[archbishop]] has huge ceremony where he tries one of these children as a vessel for [[Ravan]], but they failed because no living being can be a vessel for a [[Gods|god]], too dangerous, fucks up your physical form. It's about to happen to Ryu, he‚Äôs all adorned and dripped out, doesnt seem too long ago (can kinda see the previous lord commander with him helping them out), previous lord commander was Myriad(??idk how to write it sorry), mayo between him and [[Cas]], man looks like Emeric if he was an Au‚Äôra (Final Fantasy XIV privilege), concern in his face because he knows how its gonna end (everyone does), turns back when his hand meets with another‚Äôs, and he doesnt look so afraid anymore.
    

  

-   [[Giddyan]] and [[Maggie]] leave to find [[giants]], the Restie of the Besties stay
    
-   TEAM STAY:
    

-   Mr Jeans talking on one side, [[Varian]] on the other trying to ignore him
    
-   Quick prayer to [[Ravan]]¬†
    
-   [[CLARISSA]] WALKING IN¬†
    
-   ‚ÄúI didnt expect you to be the religious time‚Äù DEAR [[Gods|GOD]]
    
-   ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard quite a bit about your friend‚Äù shut up you piece of clothing
    
-   Bro stop looking at homie like that it's pretty awful
    

  

-   TEAM GO:
    

-   Yell at the [[giants]], they ignore them, they dont look right!!!¬†
    
-   [[Giddyan]] stands in front of one, it stares emptily thru him, eyes glowing in a deep red color, their body almost looking like on fire on deep red color, they are seeping with anger and vengeance, sees that [[Giddyan]] aint moving so tries to hit him with club, [[Giddyan]] jpeg backflips out of the way, [[Giants|giant]] looks back off into the horizon and keep walking.
    
-   [[Giddyan]] tries to stop the same one, they try to push him away, [[Giddyan]] wins the contest, [[Giants|giant]] roars and try to hit him, miss and hit into the ground, BIG BOOM can be heard on the cathedral
    

-   Scorn, the chariot,¬† is a [[Giants|GIANT]] [[Gods|GOD]] ([[Giants|giant]] that is a [[Gods|god]]) Similar to how [[Levi|Levian]] is a [[Dragon]] [[Gods|God]]
    
-   [[Giants]] n Dragons dont have [[Gods|god]]
    
-   We‚Äôre fucked lads
