## Lemms benadryl moment

-   Wheres the ground (its tar) gabagool that's a lotta gabagool, lots of ripples with every step it hurts to walk, he flies to stay off the ground
    
-   Wheres the sky ()
    
-   [[Lemm]] is in subconsusus
    
-   [[Lemm]] looks around to see anything but before he recalls speaking to someone
    
-   Now he's able to see with a physical form 
    
-   Zephyr is on Lemms Hip, he looks around and says hello are you still there whoever you are i don't know your name
    
-   Perhaps that's for the best hahaha 
    
-   Maybe
    
-   He doesn't belong to you (@ [[Varian]])
    
-   He doesn't belong to anyone but himself
    
-   Laughs @ [[lemm]] – Doesn't he wish that? Unfortunately, he really belongs to me.
    
-   And who are you 🤔
    
-   I'm his god, his lover, *bats eyelashes* shouldn't you know that? Or is he that ashamed to talk about me?
    
-   I had a few suspicions but i didn't ask yknow, privacy
    
-   Privacy? Yet here you are getting in the way of our reunion. Come here birdie :) you make a fine treat for later
    
-   Oh that's not good
    
-   The ripples at every angle ever make claws that creep out
    
-   [[Lemm]] flies higher 
    
-   They move slower but every time [[lemm]] moves, they pick up their pace, he hears the voice call out
    
-   All theses people trying to get between us he doesn't belong to you he belongs to me he's lying he he he loves me me and me alone
    
-   You said I was protected? Does that protection not apply now?
    
-   PROTECTED? I guess you are ig
    
-   But where decay settles infestation follows But i can't have creatures like you mooch off my hard work
    
-   I dont think ive been mooching
    
-   This is my domain now come here and let me squish you like the bug you are
    
-   Chain noise sound effect it hesitates and it tries to resist
    
-   What what wait what what are you doing what are you doi
    
-   All those claws get pulled back
    
-   [[Varian]] coming back to consciousness and kung fu panda starts playing
    
-   Behind [[lemm]] he hears like puddle sounds
    
-   [[Lemm]] turns around oh gawd whozzat NOW it is a small figure in very tattered clothing and white hair yanking at these chains and pulling them from the tar, some [[kyros]] grabbing the leash on his patron 💀 robe is much different, red robe with gold trimming around the edges, this [[kyros]] looks 16 and you hear them struggling to keep the patron down, they look very scratched up and bloody. This might be a younger [[Varian]] tbh, hair covering the face, they see one terrified eye with the white pupil they are gasping for air.
    
-   “[[Lemm]] what are you doing here what's going on you shouldn't be here”
    
-   I am looking for a friend looking for [[Varian]]
    
-   what? 
    
-   Oh dear enough to distract them but the chains yank them forward and pull them under
    
-   Awe shit
    
-   Tar splashes up on lemmand it BURNS ouch and things begin to grow on [[lemm]] wtf what the balls

-   Another nightmare to the list yass
    
-   Look around again for anything that's not tar
    
-   [[Lemm]] calls out for [[Varian]] panicked
    
-   Another splash, something rising from the surface, with a nice BREATHE IN
    
-   AHHH so persistent are we
    
-   I've been told i'm a bit stubborn
    
-   So are you just here to humor me? Are you here to die?
    
-   I'd rather not
    
-   Useless. 
    
-   Yea
    
-   So quick to agree. I'd like to get my hands on you 😐
    
-   Passive perception see something red in the corner of his eyes, move in that direction
    
-   That is a corpse, that is lemms corpse what da hell it is decayed and wretched and awful and it reminds him of the dream he had that kick started everything to get him here. It is exactly that he feels that exact thing
    
-   No one is here to know him :(
    
-   I would ask you to stop please
    
-   I SAID 🗣️🗣️🗣️PLEASE stop doing that ik ur here DAMNNN
    
-   Ik you dont wanna leave this place + this man so answer.. well that's rude >:T

-   Looks right down at [[lemm]], [[Lemm]] Sigma Grindset
    
-   Ok you had your fun but i'm going to ask you to stop ok
    
-   You don't even know who you're talking to hahaha
    
-   I don't and as you said and that's prolly for the best
    
-   Do you think  a little plea is going to erase 200 years of damage
    
-   Prolly not but you have to start somewhere
    
-   Aww the little birdie wants me to have a redemption arc how precious omg self aware
    
-   Never too late to start you could start now
