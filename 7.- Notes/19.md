We see a woman and she's on the floor, curled around something and crying, she's wearing a night, Notice the moment you walk around, see she is stained in blood, she is being comforted by other workers, some are [[fey]] some are not, just an assortment of workers, see the lady with long black hair curled around what seems to be a bundle in her arms. Bundle is not moving. [[Maggie]] is able to see that the bundle in her arms has blood as well??
