• **[[Briss]]** and **[[Lemm]]** have been traveling together for a few months now, and landed in the **tavern** of a quaint lil export town, called **Neverwinter!**
• The two are pulled aside by the a man named **[[Bo Burnham]],** who are offering **100 GOLD** to **transport** this totally-not-stolen supply cart down the road to the nearby town of **[[Willowfey]]** 
• **[[Briss]]** intimidates **[[Bo Burnham|Bo]]** into paying them half now, and the other half later. "Fair deal!" **[[Bo Burnham|Bo]]** shakenly agrees, and pays them both **50 gold** for their trouble. Promising to pay the other half later, **[[Bo Burnham|Bo]]** sets out on his **horse** to **[[Willowfey]]** 
• The party gets onto the cart and rides down the forest road, until **[[Lemm]]** spots a faint blue glow hidden under a tarp. Tempted to mess with it, **[[Lemm]]** leaves it be. 
• However, something else seems **interested** in the glow, as what seems to be a very chunkee **raccoon !** wriggles it's way to it from under the tarp. **[[Lemm]]** notices, lifts the tarp, and suddenly gets attacked. 
• **[[Briss]]** stops the horse she's steering to go and see what's all the commotion. She picks up the source of the glow, it being a strangely shaped **Stone Lantern** at **first glance.** She grabs the FUCK out of the raccoon on **[[Lemm]]** with a crushing strong grip, and tries to throw it off the cart. 
• After a heated, speedy battle down this road on this fast-moving carriage, the **raccoons are defeated,** leaving behind the **Stone Lantern** and a single pair of **Thieves Shades.** The carriage skrrrs to a sudden stop at one of **[[Willowfey]] docks.**
    
**[[Willowfey]]** - The [[feywild]]-occupied town of, well.. willow trees!

• The party, dazed and confused, hears a **voice** calling from afar. It's **[[Gillian]] Burnham, [[Bo Burnham|Bo]]'s** sophisticated, **noble** brother, hopping **[[Willowfey]]'s moving gondola's** to get to the party. **[[Lemm]]** quickly stashes the **Thieves Shades** in his bag, while **[[Briss]]** stashes the **Stone Lantern** 
• He instructs his men to take his supplies inside his **Artifacts shop**-- a **museum** he has created **filled to the brim** with **artifacts** from **distant lands.** Some, that he **trades and sells** with other **collectors. [[Lemm]]** even recognized one of the artifacts from his home town. Creepy!! 
• After giving him their names, **[[Briss]]** complains to **[[Gillian]]** for **his brother** not giving them the remainder of the pay. When **[[Gillian]]** asked where his brother might be, the party does not know. **[[Gillian]]** grows **concerned,** and sends the party outside as he gets his men to collect some info. 
• Outside his shop, the party gets a good look of **[[Willowfey]]** itself. Not only are the **magical willow trees**, and the **river-only streets** quite striking, but there is, in the **center of the town,** an ornate, marble statue depicting two figures. **A [[Apeling]],** holding a scythe, and a **Cloaked figure**, both reaching up as if they are shielding this town from a wave of an **otherworldly force**, also carved in the marble. 
• **[[Lemm]]** sees a lone figure cloaked in purple standing before the giant statue, at it's nameplate (which is too far for anyone to read yet). The figure takes notice of the attention, and walks off.

• **The Party** decides to check out the _Fountain_, only to be brought back inside **[[Gillian]]'s** office • Unfortunately, **[[Gillian]]** can't pay them all back unless his brother is found. So **The Party** ends up being forced to go look for him. 
• A few ways back down the path they came, **[[Briss]]** and **[[Lemm]]** take notice of a horse laying limp on the ground. It sits up, confused. 
• Peering past the brambles off the beaten path, **The Party** discovers a small **Sacrificial Camp** hosting a dying **Bonfire** and a **Rack of Golden Masks** 
• Before they can do anything, a looking figure approaches them from behind and attacks **The Party.** Upon it's defeat by a swift slash to the face, the Golden Mask it bares is knocked off. Falling limp to the ground in a pool of smoke, it is revealed to be [[Gillian]]'s brother, [[Bo Burnham|Bo]]. **[[Briss]]** ends up stashing the Golden Mask away in her pack, being able to resist it's **thrall** more than **[[Lemm]].** 
•**The Party** returns [[Bo Burnham|Bo]] back to his brother, but forget to ask any more questions about the situation. **[[Gillian]]**, concerned to be targeted, uses this opportunity to hire The Party on board to protect his archeologist crew. He is aware that a **group of rouges** have been out and about, targeting his workers and destroying ancient relics he and his museum have been trying to preserve. 
• **The Party** agrees, heading out to wait to hitch a ride along with the remaining archeologists.

• **[[Briss]]** grows quickly bored of waiting and decided to use this opportunity to get that spa appointment done that she's been continuously putting off. **[[Lemm]]** on the other hand, has their curiosity set to the **Temple of the [[Feywild]]** 
• As he enters alone, he finds a figure robed in purple kneeled to the floor, praying. 
• After a few minutes of pestering the figure, **[[Lemm]]** decides to take him to **[[Briss]]** to show him off. 
• The Figure learns that **The Party** has been set to protect the archeologist group under **[[Gillian]]'s** instruction, and warns them in strange words. He mentions of three things in particular; - That the [[Godseekers]] have returned - That the Gods themselves are falling from the skies - And that he needs to find **His Son.** 
• **[[Lemm]]** notices the figure in a more detailed light, and along with begging to know their name, asks if they are the same person in [[Willowfey]]'s monument. 
• After enough prying, the Figure gives his name to **[[Lemm]]**, though warns him of the dangers of giving your name to those of [[fey]]. 
• It is revealed his name is **[[Varian]]**, and that "he was." the figure in the statue. at least, he was that person a few years ago.
    
• **The Party** eventually hitches a ride out of **[[Willowfey]]** with the archeologist group, and into a citystate named **[[Dravania]].** 

_**----- [[Dravania]]: A city-state of Aphrodiel, home to a large population of Draconic-Like Teiflings. A city of old money, and old traditions. -----**_ 

•[[Briss]] and [[Lemm]] decide to split up in the bustling city, only to loose eachother. [[Lemm]] ends up almost getting his map stolen by an **Orange [[Apeling]],** only for the [[Apeling]] to be struck by [[Briss]], leading it to flee, mappless. 
• **The Party** travels their way through **[[New Dravania]]**, into **[[Old Dravania]]**, which is considered an ancient ruin after years and years of war passing through those lands. There, they meet with the excavation team.

• **[[Gillian]]'s Team of archeologist** are completely up in arms, arguing amongst themselves as **The Party** soon approaches 
•**[[Varian]]** has been waiting there for a few hours, listening to a few of the members air our their grievances. Arms crossed, _very_ exhausted. 
• **The Party** eventually discovers that no one is allowed into the ruins, as the Dravanias stationed there have reported people going missing into this newly-opened ravine. 
•**Ser [[Levi|Levian]],** [[Dravania]]'s next in line to be Deity, was about to be one of those people, lest he was stopped by a flock of his own overprotective scholars. 
•As the party meets him, he gains their trust by seeing how **[[Briss]]** is a royal on the Draconic-Bloodline, and _shheeee_ gets free reign to do whatever she wants without people following her every move, so why can't he!!?? 
•**Ser [[Levi|Levian]]** eventually grants the party passage due to one condition; they would allow him to travel with them! Anything, to get his scholars off his back. However, he is unaware that the party is actually here to recover artifacts. 
• **[[Lemm]]**, at the corner of his eye, sees a Fauna arguing with a Dravanian guard, who is having none of it today. Just before she was about to be escorted out of the site, **[[Lemm]]** runs up to the commotion and says that she is with his group! The guard, taking note of [[Levi]] with them, eases off of **[[Clarissa]]** and opens the gates to the ravine 
• As the party ventures downward into the ravine **[[Varian]]** takes note that there is too much ground to cover for simply one group. He decides to split from the party on his own. **[[Lemm]] and [[Briss]]** believe that it's unsafe for just one person to travel alone, but rest assured, he is as collective as ever.
    
•**The Party** takes left, traveling down a cave that seems to be made all of Crystaline material, (presumably from the giant crystal spiked into the ground) 
• As their vision into this cave grows dimmer, **[[Lemm]]** accidently activates a pressure plate. However, **[[Clarissa]]** is the one who gets hit, as a funny little **Dwarven man** ([[Dwarves]]) falls from the ceiling, (completely tied up) and crushes her. 
• The Dwarven man ([[Dwarves]])(who reveals himself to be **[[Giddyan]]**, ) quickly apologies, claiming that he is here to discover relics on his own. Completely unaffiliated with both groups, however. He's just a guye doing his own cool thang. 
•Once untied, the group finds themselves at a forked road. [[Levi|Levian]] takes samples of the crystals while the party decides where to head; either through the **Rubbled path,** filled with crumbled marble, sand, and coins, or the **Stone path,** where a slight screeching can be heard.
    
    
•**The Party** takes the **Stone path,** where crystal spikes seem to be growing all around. **[[Lemm]]** recognizes the long orange tail at first, then realized the noise is coming from **the orange [[Apeling]]** from the encounter earlier. 
• The [[Apeling]] seems to be playing a flat, stone guitar with makeshift strings tied on it all awkwardly. It sounds awful, but he's having a great time playing for the **Two People** who seem to be **trapped** up to their **necks** in this slow-growing crystal. 
•The [[Apeling]] reveals himself to be [[January]] Strider, before playing one of his songs he made. •After some shenanigans of trying to release the two, (While [[giddyan]] ran around chasing the [[Apeling]] for his guitar back) the two people are released from the crystal. One overconfident adventurer named **[[Robert]]**, and a more timid, shyer [[tiefling]] [[rogue]] named **[[Maggie]].** 
•Seeing these people barge in an attack him, **[[January]]** hits a switch in the room to sound an alarm, and closes all entrances and exits in this cave. A stone door closes, and crystal begins to slowly grow over it, potentially keeping **The Party** trapped here. 
•The alarm summons 3 redrobed figures, all ghastly, wearing the familiar **Gold Faceplates.** Each of them attack the party to protect **[[January]],** and **[[January]]** uses his daggers to defend as well. **[[Maggie]]** is the first to pull off a mask, breaking the curse on its bearer and bringing them back to mortality. (Knocked out and seriously injured) This person, as **Clarrisa** quickly recognizes, is **[[Devendra]],** the friend she traveled all this way to find again after leaving her hometown. 
•Once the battle concludes, **[[January]]** is knocked unconscious into a wall. The blast was so mighty that it shook the cave, making the crystal spikes from above begin to collapse onto **The party.**
    
•Everyone begins to rush to protect eachother and those who potentially got freed from the _Gold Faceplates_, though only **The party, Devandra, and [[January]]** survived. 
•[[Robert]] ends up picking up [[January]] and stuffing him into his bag, to interrogate later. 
•As the rest of the party tries to collect their bearings, they look around and see that [[Levi]] is gone. 
•Standing at a passageway is a **Very Large, black-robed figure** (similar to the smaller ones, only black) dawning a gold faceplate. It is holding [[Levi]] by the neck with a spider leg peeking from under it's cloak, and choking him. 
•After attempting to meld a faceplate onto **[[Giddyan]]**, the figure **Rips** the soul stone out from [[Levi|Levian]]'s back, and leaves through the entrance it came from.
    
•After a great chase after [[Zion]] who had stolen [[Levi]]'s Soul Stone, the party had to come across some strange dwelling with multiple masked cultists. 
•So some cultists were taking down The group had come across a strange knife and a really cool bowl. 
•The party had broken the mask off of one guy named Barry Bluejeans and he stumbled to try to grab another mask, [[Clarissa]] chased after him 
•The rest of the party left towards the entrance to check out a room with treasure! (and an enemy yass!!) •There were some things picked up but i forgor (like. A statue.?) 
•OK yea so the party showed up to the Big Bad Evil Guy Battleground™ and they're all surrounding the soul crystal •There’s attempts to grab the crystal, they go bad :(

(nun combing him looks offended) "I know, I know! they're cheap, and they have no historical lineage and theyre on the… "wrong side of the cupboard," as you all say, but… I look out of this stuffy darkness we're in, and I see them experiencing… lunch times, and midnight parties, and sandwiches with laughter, and all the while we're gathering dust. if the saints are so beautiful and so treasured as they say… why is it we're never touched..? I'm not too afraid of enduring fathers tests anymore, I mean… I think the cracks and chips are beautiful; they show that you've experienced life!! A-And I know we're delicate so… [[Ravan]] forbid we're broken… that... _I break,_ but… I swear too you, i would rather be shattered on the cathedral floor a million times over than staying locked in here forever… doesn't being broken merely signified that you've tried..? it is said perfectly that polished vessels can live forever... only when it has absolutely nothing to live for…"
