-   one of the eyes is kinda freaking out at “quite an alarming rate”, Ravan roars 
    
-   LOUD CRASH Ravan roars and the chains pull em downwards, the glyph shines a bit brighter, looks like it was carved in the air itself nullifying his magic
    
-   As Ravan cries out in pain, Byleth is trying to manipulate the red aether chains to keep Ravan chained (similar gloves to Estinien)
    
-   Ravan speaks to Giddyan, “I have entrusted man with my vulnerability, and while I lay beaten, my faith in mankind never wavers. I still want to believe not all mortal are single minded, for a wish to walk among them and understand them. Tell me children of the land, help me comprehend.”, he kinda gives in to the chain and collapses to the ground, the eyes begin to glow in full beautiful luster
    
-   The eyes begin to sink back into the casket, the whole cathedral begins to rumble and shake, everyone starts to lose their footing, the casket begins to radiate a dark, icy flame. Barry laughs and reaches towards the casket, trying to touch the edge of the steel, Venneer tries to absolutely vaporize him but he manages to touch the casket, it CONSUMES HIM!!? he clips through it
    
-   the casket begins to hover a bit off the ground, we are instantly met with a blast of force, pushing us back to the entrance

-   everyone singing the Joxter song we coping
    
-   primal raises his big ass sword and goes “I SHALL BURY YOU AND YOUR BELIEFS”, dragoons channeling their energy, bodies breaking as they are used, creating a formation around us, energy moving towards a point at the center, as this choir floods our head and blinds our eyes, numbs the senses for a quick moment as this man takes that sword and lowers it onto our goofy asses, and from there there is silence for a moment
    
-   As all of the rubble settles, around us there is a sort of shield of force, in a very faint icy blue kinda light, everything else is completely destrOYED, CATHEDRAL IN RUINS, SOMEHOW WE ARE STILL STANDING
    
-   The sword is right above us, right on that shield trying to crack into it
    
-   everyone absolutely going apeshit at Big Jeans while Venneer is going to attempt to banish em THE FUCKING ATTACKS COMBINING, FORMING LITTLE SIGILS LIKE THE DRAGOON RINGS, PIERCING THRU THE PRIMAL’S NECK AS THEY STUMBLE BACK, THE SWORD IS PUSHED OFF WITH VARIAN’S ARMS OF HADAR AS VENNEER GOES FOR A BANISHMENT

-   Ravan is full true dragon rn, looking nothing like Levi (still got memories tho)
    
-   Ravan rests his head, as a thank you, an indent on his head where the soul crystal should be

-   “Interesting, at least you made my life a little bit easier. Dont move”
    
-   they dont give a single shit they are just looking at byleth walking past us
    
-   “You’re lucky we didn't  have to send for lord Zion to retrieve you. This has been a waste of our time.”

-   Barry stuttering like the bitch he is “i still have time were not done etc”

-   the fighting is over, we have won (for now)
    
-   they begin to cheer as they see us 
    
-   Ravan steps out of the cathedral, a god and the last remaining pure dragon in Halune, the people seeing their god alive they rush to us and to Ravan, lifting us up and cheering

-   back at that same district where that lady was preaching, Ravan is now there with some of the giants here  
    i forgot to mention that the lady who was preaching can be seen-- she asked for leave too watch the ceremony
    
-   Ravan speaking about how the past can be mended, even tho we cant simply brush off the harm and suffering on both sides, we can still work together for a brighter tomorrow
    
-   Everyone a bit wary, this rift may never be mended
    
-   Still now, with confidence, Dravania can say that the Giantsong war has ended in peace

-   THE BANNER IS NOW FULLY REMADE, ITS DRAGON AND GIANT AGAIN!!!!
    

“My brother believes that we have become far too naive, that dragonkind is now but a pale reflection of what it once was. My brother sees us as weak, for it is man that holds us gods captive, and not the other way around.”  
Who’s to say who is right and who is wrong?**
