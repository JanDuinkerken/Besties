-   Hello, Ladies and Gentlemen, welcome to episode ONE of Jermacraft, the series where I play Minecraft. This is gonna be a Single Player Let's Play, and when I say "Let's Play", I use that term... pretty loosely, because... I'm an idiot in this game, you're gonna see lots of fails, you're gonna see lots of... triumphs, at least I'm hoping. So, go grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee, hot cup of cocoa, I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed, let me take a sip - ah, that's good cider.💀💀💀
