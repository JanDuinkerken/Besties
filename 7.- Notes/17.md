[[16]]

-   SPIDR POV many masked/red robed servants combing thru long white hair, sound of door opening and two more masked figures come in, bow to address their leader, one of em goes “my lord we’ve come to deliver a status update from Jones Cannon'', no answer, another talks “we’ve made slow progress with your mask but positive! Gotta get another fitting before (?? aether something methinks)”, silence, spidr munches butterfly nearby (pin needle thru it), “he also wanted us to tell you that his workflow would go better if he had access to the soul crystal inside Zakiel”, [[estinien]] getting up a servant puts a robe over [[estinien]]. He walks over to the table “”the people of idyllshire have no patience, we will work that man into an early grave”  
    [[5.- Artifacts|Relic]] [[January]] had chains and all, mfw pinning butterflies into canvases that's coo, looking them over, grips the edge of the table, damn a spider took a phat chunk out of the wing lmfao. DAMN💀 “if i weren't a merciful god you would be dead somethin somethin  
    ITS [[WALNUT]] does a lil kee “you were in the mood for butterflies? Ok don't eat my butterflies tho OH a LETTER? From THE ENEMY? Raised eyebrow emoji. For all I know you could've been followed.” [[Walnut]] wearing a letter like a backpack. Spider dance.
