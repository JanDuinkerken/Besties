-   [[Clarissa]] asking about splitting the ring
    
-   Gotta bring the Archfey to bring the seasons to push away the Blight
    
-   MAP BEING SHOWN
    

-   [[Dravania]] has a blue one, bright red one in Central Idleshyre, Bright green central Cindermoor, a gold one in Hunaecove, Purple one in Aztrezalean Empire
    

-   This has more to do with just the weather- “Apparently being a piece of [[Ravan]] has a lot to do with Balance, or Temperance. That is why Idleshyre desires to use it, their aether is aspected by willpower.” under the [[fey]] microscope, the crystal is Two different things mushed together, very irregular, not meant to be together.
    
-   [[Gillian]] puts the ring in some mechanism?? When it’s working on the ring, it is trying to split, but it can’t.
    
-   “Either you die by your own hand or mine, you should use your own judgment to see that this is the right thing to do.”
    
-   Calling up [[Ravan]], He is able to split the ring. If I see giant things don't freak out.
    
-   SPEEDRUN TO [[Dravania]], as a wolf.
    
-   We don't have a circle of knights.
    
-   [[Dravania]] is getting quieter, the nobles district is silent. Artisans are also out and about at night but they have to make bonfires.
    
-   Meet up with Ser [[Levi|Levian]] / [[Ravan]]
    
-   “It’s like they are using my tears to power their lights.” 
    
-   Casually puts on the r i n g thx [[Levi|Levian]].
    
-   Attempt by Ser [[Levi|Levian]] after shooing off his scholars.
    
-   White glow to part the ring, the gold aether pierces his arms.
    
-   THERE'S A SPELL BINDING TO IT?
    
-   Someone who put the binding on it has to take it off, MOON SPIRITRGAIOERGAHEO

ANOTHER OFF STAGE SCENE (ft. Clarisa and [[Lemm]])

-   [[Clarissa]] knocking on Lemms door
    
-   “Wanna look into these items?” “Yea lets go!?”
    
-   “What are we looking into!?!?”
    

-   Butterfly Shades
    

-   The shit we bout to see, ✨, all the vision is flooded by a swarm of butterflies, when they disperse, the sky above is all sorts of hues, similar to the glasses area in the [[feywild]]?? Who knows, there is a [[fey]] of sorts, long pointed ears with tassels on each ear, adjusting the butterflies in their hair, hair looks like moss oh wow so pretty, reminds of [[Winona]], enjoying the spring around them (Might be a young Oak?)IHAOBGOA ITS A YOUNG OAK, running with the glasses left behind in the grass.
    

-   Spider Ribbon
    

-    Normal ribbon tied in someones hair, not in ribbon POV, there is a lot of lights, see a crowd of people, surrounding the center, see some of the spiderlings starstruck, there are a few who are in the spotlight, Jovanni is in the seats, judging. Patiently waiting for them to start playing their music, taps orchestrator stick then put it down, see people playing a beautiful tune. One on the piano, some plucking a harp, three violinists, Nikolai is one of them, very focused, another but do not recognize, younger [[estinien]] here. Hair is long and he looks oddly peaceful, nikolai pressed asf, see [[estinien]] open his eyes slightly, he stares at someone, she’s a ballerina. She looks nervous, hey. Hey do you see this? She is not enthusiastic. Get closer to the stage, song finishes with no problems. No one claps. Jovanni gets up. Everyone (who can) folds their arms behind their back. Pre Joker Nikolai is as proud and confident as he can be, hear jovanni pace around and give the harshest critique, mostly putting the pressure on [[Estinien]] and Nikolai, Nikolai taking it harder. [[Estinien]] indifferent. Cannot stop staring at the ballerina. Jovanni notices. Starts gloating of her star pupil. Starts talking about minimal things. The other students are dispersing, the crowd is still surrounding them, Nikolai, the third one, and [[estinien]], Jovani keeps staring at [[estinien]], tilts his head up, goes “Are you hungry?” [[Estinien]] responds in thick accent “Yes, mother.” Calls off Nikolai, Nikolai is like wtf >:| from the crowd, she calls out to the ballerina, no one else is noticing. The others is like omggg girlie shes like HORRIFIED. But gotta keep cool cause Jovani. Jovani goes back to her seat. Taps her orchestrator stick and waits and watches, blissfully. Jovanis. Everything comes with a performance. EVERYTHING IS GETTING ✨WOWWW✨ they dance, it's cool to a degree. [[Estinien]] bussin it down. A nice duet wow so cool, Girlie is like ok the routine whatever, it's a little weird :| [[Estinien]] is soulless asf here. Just what he knows to do here ig, around the end, starts getting violent. Finish the dance, she collapses, bleeding. [[Estinien]] was holding a dagger in one of his sleeves, hes been GUTTING HER? SO DISCREET COULDN'T TELL?!?! No one could tell. [[Estinien]] ties up his hair, he ate the ballerina :{. Nikolai is like bro wtf??? Slaps it out of his hand. Jovani is like “Are you satisfied?” “yes mother.” Flash forward, a long while, the same ribbon being tied up in his hair, some hair strands falling out, a little bit is braided. Here in this Opera House, somewhere else, don't know where, lots of apelings, probably in [[York]]. Push through the crowds. [[Clarissa]] sees a familiar poster. Very Pretty. There is a push at my leg, smaller [[apeling]] going past me. Not as finely dressed. See the music pick up and lights go as this figure in the center plays their music. Wow so pretty. See a little bit past, there is a fine capuchin [[Apeling]], big guy, dressed in red robes, next to him is like a queen of sorts, very luxurious but not outwearing their jewels. This is set up to be their assassination. Very delicate webs at the edges of his fingers. Just as he reaches to grab something, he’s already holding the bow. See his hand go for it, but he stops upon seeing his hand gets caught. Turns around and see a few people go GASP. and in the corner sneaking around, right in front of the royal guy is [[January]] STRIDER and [[KYROS]] [[Varian]] trying to untie [[January]]. Things go in chaos immediately. King is QUICKLY escorted to LEAVE.”THIS ISN'T HOMESTUCK?!?!?! YOU LIAR?!?!” Holds up homestuck poster. Tries to go in for the kill IMMEDIATELY. [[Estinien]] Lost in [[York]]
    

-   Gold Mask
    

-    So this is interesting, we see a memory that it flips through a few things, see a limbo, with this mask, there’s surprisingly a lot of history, Start at the beginning, we are met with a massive crush, we just got hydraulic pressed, everything is hot and molten, this object is being created for the first time. On the inside there are runes being pressed and hammered in, [[Clarissa]] sees [[Estinien]] hammering the runes in SHIRTLESS ([[CLARISSA]] LOOK AWAY), He puts on the Mask, looks it over, takes the mask onto his face, see as his face contorts into [[ZION]] oh deer, crawls on the ceiling and stuff, all masks have a strange engraving on the sides, it enchants them a bit. A few of these masks didn't open up, this one included, this mask is eventually red hot. He is very determined and  wants everything to be perfect the first time (Jovani behavior), a little more into the future, see the mask at the side, in a red robe bundle, left there, lots of laughing, lots of clinking of glasses, hear people stumbling about. Idk where they are, lots of candles, see a few [[godseekers]] go in the blood pool (LOOK AWAY) [[Estinien]] is there, just there🧍 gets dragged into the rave, Future more, Mask pov, we are in [[Solus]], bundled, more talking, casual chatting. Very nice to be bundled. Baby behavior. Unveiled to see [[Clarabelle]]. She is confused and looks at the guy talking to her, takes the mask.
    

-   Lamby
    

-    Oh it's lovely, we know lamby is from the brothel, see them get dragged around by baby [[estinien]], taken to the beach, all the places around [[Valeran]], see him set up in a chair, see him with a pickle. Very sweet and cute stuff. Seeing many scenes go around. Slightly older, white roots kicking in, see him being creative with stories, see lamby in a chair as the kid runs in the bg. More of the white hair growing in, the more lamby seems loved. One day lamby is brought with him into a closet, like that for a while, and lamby is in there for a while. Until he is found once more.
    

-   Strange Parchment
    

-   Don't start out as a parchment, start as a string, then a lot of strings, and then woven to make more and more and more and then see spiders come down and around us, very tiny. They're working on this book, 3d printing a book holy shit, heeeheeeheheheeeheeeeheheheheeeehhee [[walnut]] laughing omggg, weavers weeeeheehee, looking at every page, is woven. As a spider flips thru a page, see the pretty patterns be shown thru the light, almost translucent eventually the book is closed and gets picked up and [[walnut]] follows, and brings it to a few people, they inspect it, they all congratulate the spiders, see the person, the OPERATORRR, oh 4s you saw this? Did you help? You all did such a great job! Show off the really early tech,see how we can take notes better and cover tracks better, write something in the book, one of the peoples treat out the pages,one of the spiders is like oh mg its miiiine. Its the beginning of how to do communication. OH MY GOODDDD [[WALNUT]] IS SO HAPPY and how are we going to enchant these? Talk to spiders about design [[walnut]] looks to our POV memory ends
