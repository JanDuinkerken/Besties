Literally a spiraling map.![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/7MV-5yIlGw1NQLMYlx6xKzCqOvnXOyJaWg4L8XDZHxeOjfTZxGbBO4bPujvFCZuuhpf_E8RhC--7Bc0FNP_DNHljSYAovNOXn9BZmMj2ZwR0UC-i_UjpoUd5d3v2bMhJQPEJ3P2gvHCwp3-P0w) Under those letters a string of code in different scratches. There are a lot of languages, abyssal is the common on this map I can tell the order of scratches are actually numbers they seem to go infinitely.

Observatorium has no telescope + broken glass, how does it not see¬†

-   [[Devendra]] says its like a vault, she puts the book down and with what she knows she figures out this wholeass area is divided into two thoughts, two brains, one side depicted with the sun and one with the moon, we are in the control moon of the maze
