-   “Im [[Daniel|Developer]] IEL, many of you didn't expect me to be here but I suppose the catastrophe that happened in [[Solus]] made me want to pivot my research, and I know some of you were expecting something else but a few modifications had to be made, and I met with a very good man to help me with that. I, like many of you here, I lost people I deeply cared about, not only to the Calamity, to the Blight, but to the rage of a [[rogue]] wayward [[Gods|god]]. All this time I never assumed that this was even a problem to begin with, and then [[Dravania]] and [[Solus]] happened, it made me believe so long in this darkness that humanity was the plague upon this earth, causing the Blight and the [[gods]] to descend and cleanse the world, but instead of using this rage for hate, I rather asked for humanity to stand together and stand together against the very [[gods]] themselves. As you have seen before from my previous showcase, I showed progress with the adventuring party here that volunteered to help with this project. Later today we will have a demonstration for all of you to witness. I created my angels to be piloted by adventurers who were proven worthy. Using the Aetherial Crystals research that we were provided from [[Dravania]], we are able to power these machines by using concentrated amounts of aether. Not everyone is gifted with magic, but with the power of our technology we can harness the power of this aether, and from then no one can be ‘more special’ than anyone else. Finally we will all achieve equality, not to mention how beneficial they are in the medical field”

-   From [[Valeran]], born in a brothel, there was a [[fey]] who came in and threatened to take his mother and she had to give up [[estinien]] and under miss Jovani he was raised as an assassin. We did him a favor by killing the missus. He did escape and saw the tail end of the calamity, grew spiteful of the halunic [[gods]] by then. In all of this, been trying to go back to the [[feywild]] to free the rest of the ballerinas and her curses and marks of the soul and such. Was trying to bring them to the material plane to grant them their freedom, however had to do it under the [[zion]] alias so he wouldn't get caught. Slams a fork in the table.
