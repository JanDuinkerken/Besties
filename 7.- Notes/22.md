-   [[Varian]] keeps¬†
    
-   OH MY [[Gods|GOD]] ITS JUST A SOLID PIECE OF STONE
    
-   Explosion flashbang with the stone lantern thingy being cranked
    
-   [[Kyros]] Lore Drop
    

-   NOT ACTUALLY A LANTERN
    
-   ITS A PROJECTOR OF COURSE
    
-   WE FIND OURSELVES NO LONGER IN THE LAB
    
-   What the fuck its so beautiful, windchimes in the background, drapery of the sides of mountains
    
-   Its nightime
    
-   We are all here, met with a Crowd of Figures with all sorts of Crowds and Helms and firecrackers in the sky, theres a festival going on! Figures dancing to this tune with instruments never seen and¬†
    
-   See with these figures
    

-   [[GIDDYAN]] SEES TALL ASS BITCHES‚Äì TALLER THAN [[VARIAN]]
    
-   [[LEMM]] SEES THESE FOLKS ARE VERY HAPPY, VERY BEAUTIFUL AND VERY ANCIENT, LIFE CARVED OUT OF STONE AND SKY, ONE WITH THE WORLD RATHER THAN BUILDING UPON IT
    
-   [[CLARISSA]] + [[MAGGIE]] SEES THAT THE DANCE AND THE PERFORMANCES, MASKS WITH CREATURES AND BEAUTIFUL RENDITIONS.
    
-   THE FOUR POINTED STAR WITH THE GEM IN THE MIDDLE
    
-   TRIANGLE MOTIFS
    
-   In the midst of all of¬† the laugher, one takes off their mask,¬† it is a [[Kyros]] with Long White Hair, laughing. [[Maggie]] sees them hold up a tiny [[kyros]] with tiny ears and tiny red robes , laughing.
    
-   Story that looks familiar to [[clarissa]] because of the helmet, similar in nature, but of course, the things [[Clarissa]] saw in Jovannis theatre wasnt as perfect as it were to be seen here. The Crystal looks like it was in [[the lantern]], like a reflection of a prism, see as the story goes along there is a massive figure of light, see the [[kyros]] take their hands to the sky and make illusions and create a big light made of smaller lights. Makes a big bird and it circles over in the sky. All [[kyros]] big and small look up at the sky as constellations create a manta ray esque creature. The big figure and smaller figures look over the wrealm that help them grow and see creatures worship the flame. Protected by a Stone Figure. At this era, the light and peace was strongest. It doesn‚Äôt last. The four pointed mask with the prism, the actor is very extravagant, a forbidden forest, a masked ancestor accompanies
    
-   What [[maggie]] gathers, the other masked figures are creature [[spirits]]
    
-   THEY GOTG THE CHINESE [[DRAGON]] PUPPET COSTUME THINGY
    
-   One figure picks up a dark stone, looks up to the sky, see the stone is able to absorb the light from the star and harness energy from the stars, make aerial ability for boats and contraptions and such, said being¬† other 6 [[spirits]] attach the stones to their helms, makes them very godly. That tech absorbs far too much fire. Creatures of light fall from the sky to destroy what the ancestors created.
    
-   ¬†Four pointed helm is crowned in a kingly manner, the rest worship the being like a [[Gods|god]]. The Actor is crowned with a stronger helm. The King points to the horizon asks for FORCES and FORTRESSES, create with the dark stone an arc that absorbs the souls and kill them and power their technology
    
-   ¬†Constellations sacrifice themselves to destroy this arc big ahh explosion that spreads down and consumes everything, the king is trapped in the storm, shows how the darkness consumes the land in an era of peace.
    
-   Shows how easy the light blinds as well as the dark conceals- not all is completely good or bad¬† but it just is

**BTW THAT WAS ALL A PREFORMANCE. LIKE A PLAY. IT WAS ALL MADE UP OF CONSTELLATIONS AND ILLUSIONS AND COSTUMES WITH ACTORS IT WASNT ACTUALLY REAL.**

-   Tiny [[kyros]] with the Big [[kyros]] has a pinwheel thingy and they're having a great time
    
-   WHY IS EVERYTHING HERE REAL
    
-   ARCANA CHECKS:
    

-   [[Clarissa]] is able to see herself in water, This place is like a sanctuary
    

-   [[GIDDYAN]] [[MAGGIE]] AND [[CLARISSA]], WE CAN TELL THIS IS ILLUSION MAGIC
    

-   [[Clarissa]] approaches the Projector
    

-   Feels for the source, see the stone, she slowly covers [[the lantern]] light, it is quiet
    
-   We wake up on the floor of the lab
    

-
