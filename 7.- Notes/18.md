-   ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/Ct3tBLAc3gPQZPfro1pNuWDIQjjDbrp3USu0younNO0IDKlEaKmDi44By9Y3WlDifdONZTOq5uS3wyR2AvKuFGEaoKw6Xv9oHhOrJo9FRv2E9B3Bpg8Rql1kark9_Hc5SO7JVk216oRDegE6SQ)[[Robert]] wake up routine
    
-   Nobody left to bother, [[Moondog]] time
    
-   [[Maggie]] takes her knife and tries to make the moonlight reflect on it, looking @ the reflection “hiiiiiii its mee”
    
-   Very slowly, a breeze starts to pick up, like a passing storm, trees shifting very calmly, pleasant midnight passing of the wind, after a moment she looks back at the knive and in the reflection theres a faceless entity standing right behind her
    
-   “Hiiii i wanna show you the cool stuff i got!! i got a gauntlet!! its got aether on it! i dont really know how to talk to you correctly sorry”
    
-   [[Moondog]]’s kinda not fully touching the ground, they tilt their head and one of the ears perks up, they curl around her
    
-   “Why have you called me” “I used to talk to you a lot, just thought i could do that again if it isnt bothersome” “It isnt bothersome, the skies can be quite lonely, and its thanks to you that i still can take form”
    
-   [[Maggie]] asking about someone going around with her old face
    
-   “Before the regretful one (hehespidr) i used to give faces. I gave you a face, and many others who followed. Have you lost your connection to this earth?”
    
-   “I may not have a pulse anymore, which is concerning”
    
-   [[Maggie]]’s soul lacks a body?!?!?!?!?!?
    
-   “I am sorry young one, I didnt mean for you to misplace what was previously yours, I only wished for you to live”
    
-   so [[Maggie]]’s gotta find her face wow wonder if we could have gotten it sooner hahahahaha 💀
    
-   as soon as possible because if she stalls she is fucked (fingers kinda becoming like made of stars)
    
-   if she doesnt get her face she goes to another plane cause she has nothing to tether her
    
-   [[Maggie]]’s basically keeping [[Moondog]] alive, and vice versa
    
-   asking if she can make contact with the Astral Sea, turns out it can be a very unforgiving place but some have learned to make their home there, cant tell how to communicate, but someday if she’s willing [[Moondog]] can take her there (in her current form she wouldnt be able to come back, she’s gotta focus on herself first)

-   [[giddyan]] gets inside, small cramped room,  golden metal grate in front of the entrance in front of your face, from the other side a very deep voice says “what's sins have you come to confess” and [[giddyan]] runs 
    
-   [[Robert]] goes in, he casts light on his sword (cracking open his glowstick), “hellooo??”
    
-   is the voice from a cultist? It feels like the confession booth is 2 sided, from the other side [[Robert]] hears his dad,  “pray for me father for I have sinned, I tried to save a girl from evil but the ___ overcame me. I turned my back to…. ([[robert]] leaves)”
    
-   [[Robert]] runs after his dad, we follow
    
-   “and broke my vows to [[Ocasius]] (i think)(i don't know how to write it ). The girl was reaching out but I couldn't help her. I left her to die.” The confession booth said “Here's your penance”

-   [[Robert]] takes off the ring and shows it to dad “this is …. when we put the 2 rings into 1 … I talked with [[Ocasius]] and they wanted to reform with [[Ortus]] into one. It's that way for them because they used to be one. The god is a combination of both so the prayer doesn't go anywhere. They have become 1 person, back to being a whole rather than a half ”
