-   We wake up in a rice field, we see a small little creature in the grass, they peek their head up, they’re holding a small bug before it takes off into the air, it's like a small whale, see a tiny flicker of a maroon robe, see a taller figure. Their hair is white and very long but tied up and out of the way. One tiny guy and one tall guy, we’ve seen these before but we don't remember the other having such a long mane. The taller one turns to us, we realize we can be seen. They look down at us in fear, white pupils showing, they scream at us in a language we don't understand, the moment we turn around, ayo everything goes dark who turned off the lights gahd damn. We feel the ground beneath us is rumbling, and the stone is collapsing all around us, suddenly, a bright golden light just across where we are all kneeling, begins to R I S E, collecting the stones to form itself(?), we hear big BWAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

-   “But you care for him so being with you is where he needs to be.”
    
-   “I don't desire anyone except my patron, I don't need anyone.”
