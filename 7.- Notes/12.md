RECAP 💀:  
  

 An [[elezen]] man sits at his front porch, his scenery-able, he's writing another memoir, he carefully takes the paper and takes the quill and reads the poem he's been working on.  
  
“For whom weeps the storm,  
Her tears on our skin.  
The days of our years gone,  
Our souls soaked in sin.

These memories ache with the weight of tomorrow

Who fights? 

Who flies?

Who falls?”
