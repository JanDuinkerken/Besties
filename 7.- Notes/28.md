Third floor, January Strider and the Heart of Scorn

  

January is hellbent on getting this to work. he's going too try and steal the heart of Scorn so he can regain control of estinien and use him to free Varian

  

There is an awful amount of cryptic spray painted artwork on the walls, including ghastly depictions of Varian's corpse, and decapitated heads of what he thought were his friends

  

January, visibly, looks like he's been crying for days straight. Behind those dirk strider shades are two wild eyes that dart every which way, as he holds out his two cultist daggers.

  

His back is facing the party

  

"IT'S NOT FAIR! THAT STUPID OPERATOR, THAT STUPID FORTNITE SKIN, EVERY TIME I THINK SOMEONES GONNA HELP ME, THEY SCREW ME OVER!!!"

  

Varian: ‚Ä¶ January.

  

Jan, visibly sobbing: Mah?¬†

  

He turns around, a flash of red can be seen from behind his shades.

Display remaining symptoms of Scorns thrall

January believing The Party is evil and trying too kill him/separate him from his best friend¬†

January hearing voices of the party taunting him, even if it's not true

January thinking the world is against him and he is alone; is quick to pull the trigger on sudden movements.

  

Jan: This isn't real.. You arent.. real! What are you.. doing here??

  

Varian: i'm here, January. it's me.

  

Initiative begins, January and Varian meet in the center in a dramatic clash

  

January: "I JUST NEED TO BE IN CONTROL! IM OLD ENOUGH! I CAN BE IN CONTROL"

  

Varian: please‚Ä¶

  

January: "THE GODSEEKERS WERE GOING TO HUNT US DOWN AND KILL ME! FOR MONEY! BUT THEY CHANGED! I DONT HAVE TOO KEEP RUNNING ANYMORE MAH! IM FREE FROM RUNNING! WHY CAN'T I FREE YOU FROM YOUR RUNNING??? WHY!!! WHY ARE YOU STILL STUCK??

  

Varian: stop.. I beg of you..

  

January's fighting dialogue, through his tears all choked up:

  

60% J: "DONT WORRY, MAH! IM GOING TO KILL YOU NOW!"

  

30% J: "YOU HAVE TO DO THIS! PLEASE! I JUST WANT YOU TO BE OKAY!"

  

25% J: "WHO HAS HELPED YOU, MAH? THIS ENTIRE TIME I WAS GONE, DID ANYBODY BOTHER TO EVEN HELP?"

  

V: "it's not their burden to face, I refuse to--"

  

J: "--THEYRE STRONG ENOUGH TO KILL GODS YET WONT EVEN KILL THE ONE THATS HURTING YOU!! THEY DONT CARE ABOUT YOU, MAH! THEY DONT CARE ABOUT EITHER OF US!"

  

The two take out their weapons and begin fighting each other, Cue venneer gets a vision of his brother being trapped within the heart, "struggling from the pain of his sickness"

  

10%:¬† Varian: "I can't fight you. You must let this go. Our Paths will eventually merge--"

  

January: "ENOUGH ABOUT YOUR STUPID FORESIGHT ALREADY!"

  

J: "WHAT DO YOU SEE, VARIAN? IF YOU KNOW HOW THIS IS GOING TO END, WHY DONT YOU JUST SAY IT RIGHT NOW!?? HUH??¬†

  

strikes him with Varian's¬† own staff

  

J: "TELL ME!!!"

  

drops the staff, Varian takes it, grabs it just in time to stop January from coming down on him with that dagger

  

J: "TELL ME E E E E!"

  

Once down for the count, Varian begs his patron to cast spare the dying on jan

  

Varian holds January close to his chest, tearful

  

Varian: "You're alright... January, I'm sorry‚Ä¶ all i wanted was to find you a home... the open road is no place for a child..."

  

January: "but... im not a child, ma..."

  

Varian: "you'll always be mine."

  

a loud explosion, as the tower begins to crumble. The Chariot is opened, the party takes the Soul Crystal from the core. Idyleshire powers down in a state-wide blackout.

There are stairs that lead upwards to the roof, the party must reach them as the building falls around them.¬†

  

The Rooftop

  

They approach up to the roof to see Estinien, who has made it up the tower a good few minutes earlier than the party. He's a little ways off, and looks as if any sudden movements would send him attacking.

  

Zak-IEL: "IT HUUUUUUURTS hurts IT HURTS WHEN I TRY TOO THINK"¬†

  

Daniel: p-please, calm down! you don't need to protect me anymore!

  

Zak-IEL: WE'RE GOING TO MAKE IT!!¬†

TO.G HETH.E R

  

Zak-IEL is both happy to be alive and distraught; they are limited to a body. They scream and cry and keep perfectly bouncy as they tell you how much they love and hate being alive. They are over their cringe robot phase, and much rather take their new friends to their home in what they refer to as "The Labyrinth of Winds"

  
  

Estiniens Judgement:

  

"Out of the night that covers me, black as the pit of the voids pole, I thank whatever Gods may be for my unconquerable soul.¬†

In the fell clutch of circumstance, I have not winced, not cried aloud. Under the bludgeonings of chance, my head is bloody, but unbowed.¬†

Beyond this place of wrath, and tears, looms that the horror of the calamity. And that the menace of the years finds and shant find me... unafraid. It matters not how straight the gate, how charged with punishments and scroll... I am the master of my fate... I AM the champion of my soul...

  

And so are you."

  

**Initiative cues**

  

Combat dialogue¬†

  

100% Estinien: you only follow him bc he got to you first. He plagued your mind, numbed ur senses of everything thats good for u

  

60% "you know what I noticed? you're very quiet, when fighting for your lives. you don't cry... you don't scream... you don't bargain...¬† you just do what you do best; be silent, ruthless killers. like the true villains you are.

  

30% Estinien: you're so desperate to preserve the past, Varian. How long are you going to keep pointing these people in the wrong direction? Do you think by straying them, you're sparing yourself from letting them dig up your past? You're only delaying the inevitable.

  

Varian: ...Some things are better left undiscovered.

  

*Combat ends*

  

Estinien is killed before the mask explodes. "The Walnut effect" or, aka, The mask gives him that second life moment.

Estinien climbs back up, bloodied and distraught at his failure.

  

Maggie is probably gonna darken the sword, so get rid of it. Fool.

  

The towers shake and crack, and the party looks around to see that their chunk of building has ascended at least a few miles into the air.

  

Estinien: no‚Ä¶ NO.. THIS IS ALL WRONG! WHY MUST WE SUFFER SO???¬†

(accuses party ahh fuck you ahhh)

There must be a way to restore things to the way they once were! to reverse the calamity! to reclaim the perfect paradise we once had!

  

Varian: "No‚Ä¶ suffering exists. And we cannot pretend otherwise. If we are to live, we must accept it as our constant companion.

We mustn't forget this tragedy. We cannot honor the sacrifice by forgetting our history.¬†

¬†let us carry it in our hearts estinien. So that we may grow stronger, and know true happiness."

  

Estinien, struggling: WE CAN'T ACCEPT IT! WE WON'T ACCEPT IT! IT WILL BE OURS AGAIN! A WORLD FREE OF THE CALAMITY! A WORLD FREE OF SORROW!

  

¬†Varian: "No, it will not! For there has ever been sorrow! Mankind was only spared it's biting sting for a time!¬†

  

V: So please‚Ä¶ open your eyes. To try and reclaim those lives we have lost by sacrificing more isn't wisdom! it is weakness!

  

V: No paradise is without it's shadows‚Ä¶ If we cannot accept this Truth and learn from our Past...then our plight will be repeated."

  
  

Sunspider Moment if Clarissa allows¬†

  
  

Estinien, filled with pain and loss and utter distress, begins his prayer of ascension

  

E: Oh merciful Zion, god born of our boundless faith‚Ä¶ we bid you‚Ä¶ hear our prayer! Accept this offering of lives! And deliver onto us the lives we once had! Deliver onto us the days of old! The days when Halune was a fountain of love! And we knew naught but bliss!"

  

¬†The cultists around the party give their final breath as their souls leave their body, Aether of their life essence being drawn into the air

  

Varian, seeing this happen around him, begins to speak

  

V: Lands that stretched on forever. Skies one could drown in.¬†

The heartbeat of nature, silent yet strong.

  

Varian: And amidst it all, my friends. Beacons of light and life. Laughter that warmed my heart like naught else before.

  

To shut Varian up, Estinien gets the upper hand with a reckless, angry slash, and uses his whole strength to drive his cultist dagger up and across Varian. The dagger's effects try to "sunder" Varian and split him open.

  

With a painted gag, the kyros falls to the floor, and is hoisted up by Estinien by the scarf.¬†

  

Varian decides to give Estinien what he wants the hard way. He lifts up his undershirt to press his hand to one of his tattoo'd "gifts" his patron forced upon him.

  

Varian: They are my meaning and my purpose.¬†

My Love.

  

Estinien: Enough Of Your Distractions. You would try to ruin it?? OUR PERFECT WORLD???

  

Varian: In spite of... or perhaps because of this, I choose to believe. in mankind's potential. In his ability to find a way forward.

  

Varian: So let there be no way back. From that temptation, I sunder us. No longer shall mankind have wings to bear him unto paradise.

  

Varian: Henceforth, he shall walk"

  

Varian's patron begins to reach and try to split Varian apart themselves, but by the time the building begins to crumble, Varian sees this and quickly begins to fight against their patron, going against this fate

  

Cue the end of Soken's "Answers" as they fall, mentioning Judgement, The Dravanian War, and Scorn in the bg

Raise Vol. Emphasis on:

"Tell us why, Given life, we are meant to die, helpless in our cries?"

  

Grimore Zephyr, putting the blame on Varian, begs Lemm to let him help.

  

In a moment of weakness, convinces Lemm to allow them to escape this danger, much as how he escaped the danger in the vault.

  

"In a single fleeting moment, one must live, die, and know"
