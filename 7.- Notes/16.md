# THE BESTIES NOTES

[[15]]

### Off Stage Scene ft. [[Clarissa]] + [[Estinien]]

-   Spidr walking [[Clarissa]] to a more secluded area
    
-   Insert the big ahh opera house layout of big stage + dance floor + 2nd floor balconies that look down on the dance floor + stage in a thrust stage style.
    

-   Jumping off the balcony is easy, 2 horse tall drop.
    

-   Walking in a big ahhh garden (at first artificial flowers and then soon Real Flowers though they are used as filler pieces to bring out the artificial pieces.) 
    

-   Garden goes out for miles fr fr
    

-   There's a passage downstairs (like to the kitchen??) somewhere. 
    

-   Half the garden seems to harbor a stage, masked employees are setting something up.  Might be part of the presentation. There are ye Ole speakers and lights and contraptions. 
    

-   There's a part in the garden where Layout is similar to ACNH museum butterfly garden. Very pretty.  [[Clarissa]] manages to plant a white heather as a gift to the host here. 
    

-   Yea this place just needs a little ✨️druids touch✨️
    

-   Anyways uh gay people 😔💔 insert unimportant deets [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qojXeU0RtEGGSWkJeuSlItdTMxVLJX8gUtutcIYsGVU/edit?usp=drivesdk)
    
-   IMPORTANT DEETS
    

-   This was intended as a trap for [[Varian]].
    
-   Apparently [[Varian]] may be around
    
-   They are using [[January]] as BAIT
    

-   [[January]] location possibilities: Downstairs 
    

-   THERE'S A SECOND SOUL CRYSTAL SOMEWHERE. Didn't push for more info.
    

-   iirc doesn't [[January]]. have one 🧍 like ate one or sumn before [[Dravania]] idk
    
-   Also [[Estinien]] casually wearing [[January]]'s [[5.- Artifacts|relic]]
    
-   [Game Theory pt 1] I think they're going to use [[January]] as a sort of demonstration??? To win the favor of the people?? as he is the crime rate of [[York]] and all
    
-   [Game Theory pt 2. Soul crystal in the Aether Garrison. Or it might be aether so condensed it was able to take on a solid form.]
    

-   Obnoxious kissing noises "and they were both [[fey]]" more obnoxious kissing noises 👩‍❤️‍💋‍👨 
    

-   After unimportant details, [[Clarissa]] has the Ring of Judgment stashed on her person.
    

###  No Longer off Stage Scene

-   Left off in the midst of this party, [[Robert]] has strayed from the dinner table. Giddy found that lady he flirted with earlier and flew out the window (metaphorically). There is another area that is separate from the dance, very fancy, nice centerpieces, zions folks know how to cook (from the prime rib thursdays)
    
-   If theres [[fey]], they blend in too well to tell.
    
-   Party (minus [[Clarissa]]) reconvenes to talk of what they found.
    

-   Need to sabotage, not sure how.
    
-   They all recall “no violence please oh good great heavens”
    
-   Roberts is like “No, we can't talk to people.”

-   Blue lipstick smears lmao
    
-   [[Clarissa]] got the ring.
