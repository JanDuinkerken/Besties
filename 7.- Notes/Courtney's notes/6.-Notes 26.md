#Notes/Courtney 
- Been in [[Dravania]] for a week, the country isn't doing fantastic but definitely better than when the [[0.- Besties|besties]] were the Holy Sea.

- [[Maggie]] gives [[Clarissa|Clari]] her [[Dragoon]] armour.

- [[Venneer|Venne]] got his commission from The Goldsmith: a wyrm earring with little stars. the [[dragon]] goes through the ear with stars dangling. resistance to cold aspected damage.

- [[Maggie]] teacher [[Soup]] some tricks, sets up a dance routine to go along with the music they can play.

- [[0.- Besties|Besties]] decide it's a good time to get brunch and consider their options.

- [[Clarissa|Clari]] spots a quaint little keep nestled between two other shops: [[Azure Wyrm]]

- it's a perfectly...average autumn day.

- inside there's a few [[Elezen|Dravanians]] working with [[giants]] bringing out food for folks. occasionally a [[dragon]] will fly in, shift into their humanoid form, grab a bag in their mouth and transform back to fly off.

- we take a seat and instantly two small lizard [[dragon]] things bring a pot of ginger root tea and a keg of house ale. cute lil UMBRELLA. a lot of the stuff on the menu is hearty, not a sugary menu.

- MENUUU:

    - quiche with a side of

    - hand pies

    - [[walnut]] cake

    - fig tart

    - scallion pancakes

    - daybreak meat platter: oxen, owlbear, a bunch of other beasts

- [[Walnut]] crawls out of [[Clarissa|Clari]]'s hair to join the group. [[Giddyan|Giddy]] taught [[Walnut]] how to swear. [[Walnut]] wants foods, he points to the green scallion pancakes.

- The waiter takes our order, nearly knocking [[Lemm]] out with his tail as he walks away.

- [[Maggie]] pops [[soup]] on the table to give the party the dance show.

- a lot of the food here has a dwarven twist.

- [[Maggie]] is about the only person who eats normal, [[Clarissa|Clari]] is folding her fries.

- Once everyone has had their fill, buckle down to make plans.

- [[Clarissa|Clari]] asks how [[Maggie|Maggies]] fingers are - fingers are still clustered stars. [[Venneer|Venne]] asks what's up with that. Her body was lost, she needs to find it, she died, the moon brought her back it's all cool. some people have seen it, it's walking around on its own, it's a mask.

- [[Maggie]] asks wtf is up with [[Giddyan|Giddy]]'s dad. she thought they were with the [[giants]] before, he says its a long story but kind of. his village was raided, everyone died, he left. He doesn't think its his dad or if it is the [[godseekers]] are controlling him somehow. if not he'll beat him up.

- What the fuck is up with the worm thing, [[Lemm]]. He apologises for the almost [[Venneer|Venne]] murder, maybe be a bit more careful next time. Maybe...less worm next time.

- [[Varian]] is SO done with us.

- some [[fey]] are bootlegging airship, they dont work great avoid if possible.

- they're going to go to [[Idyleshire]], [[Venneer|Venne]] very much needs to know [[Daniel]] is okay. He tells them they need to be careful, it won't be fun, they're all too...non-[[human]] and magical, some kind of diguise will be needed.

- [[Venneer|Venne]] suggests all the mounts are left behind, far too magical. He says they should take the bus - [[Lemm]] and [[Maggie]] know a bus is a fluffy long cat with an opening on the side, they crawl around taking you where you need to go in [[willowfey]]. [[Clarissa|Clari]] rode one, but she wouldn't call it a bus because it doesn't have ears or legs.

- ![[a bus.png]]

- [[Clarissa|Clari]] has something that can help us be quieter. [[Maggie]] has a disguise kit and some stealth potions.

- they'll get kitted out in Idyleshirian clothing, [[Clarissa|Clari]] has an [[Idyleshire]] dress.

- [[Venneer|Venne]] doesn't have a bellybutton. [[Lemm]] thinks [[Venneer|Venne]] is from an egg cause he doesn't have a bellybutton either.

- we scamper back to [[willowfey]] to stock up on anything needed and grab some clothes for [[Idyleshire]].

- Everyone's applewatch rings. Pippin! asks where we've been. we're on our way back to [[willowfey]]. we just DIPPED for two weeks without telling anyone anything. [[Gillian]] wanted him to tell us he went over to Feyhouse to bring us dinner and we weren't there and he was just left standing there for like 4 days and was wondering where the [[0.- Besties|besties]] were. Feyhouse said it was occupied but no one was in it, not even [[Clarissa|Clari]]'s mother answered the door. they thought they died in the house and it consumed them - can't actually prove if that would happen.

- He wont tell [[Gillian]] we went on vacation and when we get back they can work on getting the next soul crystal in ZAK-iel.

- [[Venneer|Venne]] hopes they refrigerated the casserole.

- Emi is doing demon checks. there are [[fey]] riding carts being pulled by [[Giants|giant]] dragonflies, bees and ladybugs. we're cleared of demons and allowed to pass.

- the [[Elezen|Dravanian]] population there has decreased, its much less crowded now, much more peaceful, no more [[dragon]] frat parties now only [[fey]] frat parties.

- Head to the F.A.C. first, [[Gillian]] is tending to some of the [[5.- Artifacts|relics]] the [[0.- Besties|besties]] have brought in. everything is stable in the F.A.C. at the moment after the last...catastrophe. asks if we had any strange side-effects from the weird light machine. Maybe thats why [[Venneer|Venne]] doesn't have a bellybutton. [[Gillian]] makes a note of loss of bodyparts.

- hastily convince [[Gillian]] the Talus isn't an [[5.- Artifacts|artifact]] and there's no point in it being kept in the F.A.C. eventually he gives in. ([[Gillian]] is...definitely the half [[elezen]] he's pretending to be, definitely not maybe [[fey]])

- does he have a bellybutton? yes, very much was born.

- [[Walnut]] is gonna help [[Venneer|Venne]] and [[Maggie]] make the bus costume. [[Venneer|Venne]] asks [[Varian]] to be the judge of the costume contest.

- [[Maggie]] offers some ballbearings, would that work in the plastic trophy. [[Venneer|Venne]] says they should make it a metal prize then so it's louder. [[Varian]] asks if more noise is good, V says yes drunk people like childish things so noise is good.

- they all split up to work on their various party planning. [[Giddyan|Giddy]] & [[Soup]] team music. [[Lemm]], [[Clarissa|Clari]] and [[Varian]] team food. [[Venneer|Venne]] and [[Maggie]] team entertainment.

- [[Venneer|Venne]] has only been to one other party and it was a work party, this will be his first proper one they're very stressed about it being fun. [[Maggie]] says it'll go great, dont worry about it and if it goes badly they'll kick everyone out and pretend it never happened - V's very good at denial, he acquiesces. They ask [[maggie]] what people who like each other do at parties. dance, sing, talk to each other.

- [[Venneer|Venne]] suggests MATH PROBLEMSS, uno. party games with cups, ball bearings as marbles, a number 1 scientist badge for whoever solves the math problems. they steal the drapes to make decorations, thieving gremlins in the background as everyone else is doing their tasks. The trophy for the costume contest is [[Maggie]]'s ant bong with a ribbon tied round its neck and some ballbearings thrown inside. [[Venneer|Venne]] hangs up the remainders of his copper firebugs as decoration.

- [[Giddyan|Giddy]] goes outside to prep the music vibes, he has the screaming candle, his guitar, [[soup]], and the evil flute.

- [[Giddyan|Giddy]] decorates with a bunch of colourful rocks - rock concert. [[Giddyan|Giddy]] is incredibly nervous about this performance, he's never played for an audience.

- [[Varian]] doesn't understand the concept of purchasing. accidentally steals food, [[Clarissa|Clari]] hastily running behind him to pay for the goods.

- At another stall he's inspecting a tomato very carefully, and [[Lemm]] and [[Clarissa|Clary]] finally catch up.

- [[VARIAN]] PLS THE MOST AWKWARD BEAN. he thanks for the wonderful produce and walks off without paying.

- He looks at the shopping list and it's just a drawing of [[Venneer|Venne]] and [[Maggie]] causing havoc. oops.

- [[Clarissa|Clari]] will have to make some adjustments to her recipes, but she's going with mainly pastas, baked goods and soups. Maybe pickles as that's [[0.- Besties|Bestie]] food. they find a nice jar of imported pickles from [[Valeran]]. there's a familiar feather floating in the brine: a [[Lemm]] feather. the boiled egg wizard who is selling the pickles is staring directly at [[Lemm]]. Threatens [[Lemm]] that if he doesn't buy a boiled egg he'll show up to his house and pelt them with eggs. EXTORTIONATE EGG PRICES. a bargain is struck and he has to pay boiled egg wizard 5 gil every session until it reaches 50.

- Meanwhile [[Varian]] is having a great time just...taking things.

- Returning back to feyhouse, they see [[maggie]] and [[Venneer|venne]] causing havoc, and can hear the horrific sounds of the screaming candle and the cursed flute from the back yard.

- Team Food: Blompkin [[soup]] (burnt carrots, it's not sweet but still good), tomabo [[soup]] ([[lemm]] burnt the tomabo), cheesy bread, [[fey]] alfredo (its pretty decent, REALLY sweet), peach dumplings (a singular jumbo peach dumper)

- [[Venneer|Venne]] and [[Maggie]] come show off their prizes, and the math problem. [[Venneer|Venne]] hands out keycards with the solution colour-coded.

- [[Giddyan|Giddy]] and the Squanchers. they're going to sell band merch from their bus costume.

- [[Walnut]] is going to drive the costume bus. [[FEY]] seamstress for the bus costume and also for the [[Idyleshire]] clothes. Miss Sunflower seamstress. she may steal part of your soul. TRANSPORT EXTRAVAGANZA is the theme.

- she loves extravagant clothes. she knows [[Venneer|Venne]] was in [[york]] says it was a pity they didn't manage to take him. he denies having been there.

- [[Venneer|Venne]] offers the bus costume drawing. she's not happy with this, but [[Venneer|Venne]] convinces her a challenging theme creates your best work. maybe a performative art piece where they turn from the bus into the people getting OFF the bus. 'The Busties' needs to be written on the side. she suggests a disco ball on the second floor of the bus.

- we hop onto the platform, a buzzing in our cores and looking into the mirror the sunflower pulls out our reflections and become fabric. she starts assembling the fabric people into our outfit.

- she KNOWS things!! she knows about the math problem for the party.

- there's already a crowd of people waiting outside Feyhouse when we get back. [[Clarissa|Clari]] asks the house not to eat the guests as we're having a party. they grumpily agree.

- [[Walnut]] is wearing a little bus driver hat. we do our wonderful transformation from bus to people!

- People are dressed as bees, catbuses, carts, all sorts of public transport. [[Gillian]] is dressed normal except his head is peeking out from a fluffy bee situation.

- [[Venneer|Venne]] dashes off to start the math problem.

- Some people are eyeing the food, curious to see what we're serving but unsure if its time for food yet. [[Clarissa|Clari]] starts serving.

- chatting with one of the [[fey]] that's been served, she flinches on the first bite. its a recipe from Solas, they prefer savoury flavours there.

- MUSIC TIIIME!! The merch table is being manned by Driver [[Walnut]]. someone lifts up a shirt, drawn in sharpie '[[Giddyan|Giddy]] and the Squanchers'. they want to know if [[Giddyan|Giddy]] is worth all that, should they get the merch.

- [[Giddyan|Giddy]] sets up and starts the performance. [[Soup]] dog hits it. candle screechin in the back, flute yeeping and forcing everyone to cover their ears as folks in attendance are [[fey]], including [[Venneer|Venne]] and [[Gillian]]. [[Giddyan|Giddy]] tries to shut up the flute but it plays louder, he punts it off stage. [[Soup]] cranks it so hard Everything within [[Giddyan|Giddy]]'s line of sight becomes a bit pixelated, including himself.

- people are STOKED about the performance, they flood the merch table with gil. [[Lemm]] helps [[Walnut]] with the merch table, saying for an extra fee [[Giddyan|Giddy]] can sign merch. we make 2k gil.

- [[Maggie]] gives everyone pens and crayons for the math problem. Aethirical imbalances, all the scientists here are experts in this field they know the archfey that turn the seasons. Even Pippin is ALL IN on this. none of them understand Aether to the point of using it for tech, they only know it exists and respect that it exists, the power is used to push the seasons. he discovers from their talking that there are 4 seasons: Spring, Summer, Winter, Autumn. a lot of people here believe autumn is the lack of seasons rather than an actual season as there is no Autumn archfey.

- a sylf rummages through [[Venneer|Venne]]'s back pocket and holds out the uno cards. UNO MATCH. the whole party comes over to play UNO. at the mention of cards, [[Lemm]] looks over and watches [[Varian]] crack his knuckles.

- [[Venneer|Venne]] wins a weapon in the last round of betting - stag beetle's cleaver: 1d8, can only cast spell once per day - thunderwave. it kind of unfurls to have stag beetle horns. the sword is used to cut the [[Giants|giant]] peach dumper.

- COSTUME CONTEST TIIIME: gotta find [[Varian]] to be the judge.

- [[Varian]] is just as D r u n k as [[Lemm]].

- he's a little ways outside in the garden. the garden is very well tended to but no one has picked anything, its very overgrown.

- [[Venneer|Venne]] manages to hoof [[Varian]] up, arm slung over his shoulder. he's not fully there, but they head inside.

- [[Clarissa|Clari]]'s youngest sister hops off the fence and runs inside, [[Clarabelle]] who was talking with [[Gale]] heads inside as well.

- [[Venneer|Venne]] tinks the glass and accidentally shatters it. [[Varian]] picks off pieces of the glass, but ends up soaking the alcohol into the outfit.

- [[Venneer|Venne]] tells [[Varian]] to follow his heart, they'll give some advice though.

- a [[fey]] approaches, Sleeps, dressed as a dragonfly on wheels making takeoff noises. 6/10, looks like a 9 as it was upside down. [[walnut]] - 10/10, [[Venneer|Venne]] - 8/10.

- next: [[Maggie]] as a seat belt that has [[soup]] belted in. [[Varian]] - 10/10. [[Venneer|Venne]] tries to hold up a 10 but accidentally holds up a 0, [[Walnut]] holds up a pic of spider.

- [[Gillian]] - be being worn like a lions mane. 5/10. [[Varian]] holds up [[Walnut]].

- [[Giddyan|Giddy]] - dressed as the car part. DISQUALIFIED.

- [[Clarissa|Clari]] - butterfly fit. not on theme, but sure is a costume. gets a participation ribbon.

- [[Lemm]] - random shit piled on his wings, makes plane noises and ZOOMS across the stage. [[Walnut]] - 10/10, [[varian]] - 10/10, V - 10/10. Lemme just. leaves. into a wall. falls down.

- [[Walnut]] pushes the bong towards [[Lemm]] where he's conked out on the floor.

- MATH PROBLEMMM: Pippin has been the most confident he's got the winning answer. he's confidently fixing his attire. he KNOWS he's going to get. the answer is six. Pippin looks anime ultimate shock. brain exploded, baffled.

- a little ways back in the crowd someone cheers. [[HERCULES]] WONDERBREAD has won. puts the pin on the furby and gives it to wonderbread. he's wearing very fine spectacles as a proper intellectual.

- everyone is going bonkers with excitement. the party was a BIG HIT.

- everyone settles in now that all the excitement is over.

- we're quitting our jobs to be fulltime [[Giddyan|Giddy]] and the Squanchers tour team.

- [[Soup]] is playing all their music at once.

- [[Clarissa|Clari]] has been soaking up this whole situation and playing host. people are trying to cut into [[Giants|giant]] peach, she takes out comically large cake cutter and gives it a slice. she passes out desserts to everyone.

- the [[fey]] that was asking about the food earlier walks by and asks about the place she said all this food is from, it must be a nice place she'll visit sometime. she can put some orders in with [[gillian]] to send them in that direction if [[Clarissa|Clari]] would like.

- [[Clarissa|Clari]]'s mum has been helping her hand out peach, she thinks the food is a big success, tastes exactly like how grandma made. now that everything cleared up in [[Solus]], she's thinking of heading back, making sure the bakery is okay. [[Clarissa|Clari]] doesn't have to escort them, they can make their way.

- Clarabell is a bit hesitant about leaving, she kinda likes it here. she can visit but she'll only tell [[Clarissa|clari]] when she's in town cause [[Clarissa|clari]] freaks out about everything.

- there's a limbo tournament in the backyard, [[Lemm]] is the pole.

- as this is happening, the scene cuts to Operator 2-10, walking at a fast pace through what can be assumed is a facility, lights dimmed bright red, siren blaring in the distance. they dont bother to quicken their pace. pressing their palm to one of the doors, the whole mechanism opens and in a really quick swoop smoke dissipates from the room. They step into the room, arms crossed. [[Daniel]] looks up from where he is in shock and panic.

- [[Daniel]] was looking for a way to escape, using what tools he had to break through an opening. he ALMOST had it, but was caught in the act. 'we dont have time for these games, [[Daniel|developer]]. [[Zion]] awaits whether you like it or not.' door slides shut.

MY BOOOYYYYY
