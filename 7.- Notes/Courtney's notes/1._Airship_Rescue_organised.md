## Brunch Summary

session 19 summary: 
[[0.- Besties| Besties]] went to [[Valeran]] this time [[Clarissa]] divebombs inside insert wine aunt joke. town is like we're going to exercise a demon in the club (in an abandoned brothel) they start looking into the memories of items they find and cleansed the bad vibes blood notes. Didn't cleanse the pickles though so might be haunted. they eventually find themselves in a puzzle and struggle for an eternity before eventually solving the riddle. They fought corrupted beasts called [[Sin Eaters]] and celebrated by bathing in a pickle brine hot tub. 
-
Successfully completed the exorcism and can finally continue on their bumblefuck adventure. after pickling in the brine they head back upstairs and step out and see [[Varian]] talking to [[Carlos Perth|Father Perth]]. [[Robert]] left to do some thinking and they're escorted through some weird catacombs to leave and the moment they do leave they're instantly swarmed by ecstatic workers celebrating the defeat of the demons. they allllll insist, all of them from the conga-line and Rosalia that the party go with them to the casino across the street. The party have been meaning to go there since they arrived and agree. the conga-line of [[Elezen|dravanians]], [[Elezen]], fauna and [[fey]] take as much pickles as they can carry and head over to the casino. 
-
They find themselves in the big busy casino across the street. [[Giddyan]] recognises the dwarven pirates that were hanging about, [[Lemm]] sees the guy in the back who's still hotboxing on his 50th goddamn cigar. the Golden Circle Casino is a typical overdone casino that's a little bit feytouched here and there. 
-
they're going to have some drinks to celebrate still being alive
-
the pickle vibes are very strong the party is very pickled and slimy. 
-
[[Maggie]] definitely robbed some of the catacombs so she'll buy a round for the party. she grabs whoever is closest, [[Giddyan]] and drags them over to the bar. 
-
[[Maggie]] pulls herself up onto a tall stool at the bar to order drinks while [[Lemm]] and [[Clarissa]] hear a familiar voice cheering and whooping a little ways behind them all. Pippin is dancing with a lampshade on his head, surrounded by a bunch of workers so much taller than him, two drinks in each hand. 
-
gold system: gil (hard g). the 5 drinks cost about 25 gil. they get [[Varian]] the frutiest of drinks, they dont really drink so he looks baffled and slowly slides their drink over to [[Giddyan]]. 
-
the moment [[Clarissa]] lifts it to her mouth she takes an accidental giant drink, slams the cup down and falls down on the counter. maybe she should have something non-alcoholic next time. 
-
[[Giddyan]] sees the man sitting adjacent to them, like the Kingpin from spiderverse, there's a few other people around him. they're all playing a card game and he seems to be winning giving a big hearty laugh as he bets a lot of gil and some weapons, it looks kind of fun. [[Maggie]] suggests they check it out and if they can find out how to cheat they can join. 
-
[[Clarissa]] watched happily while [[Maggie]] and [[Giddyan]] gamble away their wares. 
-
when [[Maggie]] and [[Giddyan]] are caught cheeting, [[Maggie]] convinces big guy Mr Green that they were actually just playing by the new casino rules they learned at the [[Daniel|developer]] expo in [[Idyleshire]]. they detail that meat and meatballs are not only allowed but also encouraged. They win Mr Green's yacht and decide to make a hasty retreat before their deception is noted. 
-
[[Clarissa]] bumps into Pippin on the way and scoops up the Bee as they scoot scoot out of the casino much to his utter displeasure. the Bee has a tiny little party hat and ends up walking but they're too fat to fit through the door. The party works together to smush him through the door. [[Varian]] is just watching all this with disbelief. 
-
They all end up on the cobblestone streets, bright blinding sun pounding down upon them. Pippin escaped, running back inside while they were tryna get the Bee out the door. 
-
they're going to have to press the car alarm to find out which yacht is theirs among the docks of boats. from far off down the dock they hear a familiar voice, the worst sound they've ever heard and they see [[Robert]] trying to wave them down and and as they walk towards him they hear a chirp sound as [[Giddyan|Giddy]] presses the yacht button and a [[Giants|giant]] yacht crashes down onto [[Robert]], absolutely enveloping him. the yacht fell from the sky, it's an AIRSHIIIPPP. [[Clarissa]] remembers these from [[Idyleshire]]. It has little flaps on the sides, lined with Aether and along the base. massive light blue Aether crystals that look like the ones they saw in [[Old Dravania]] but these are much more refined and used for this vessel specifically. 
-
[[Clarissa]] asks the Bee if it wants to go back to partying, they might not need him with the flying boat. it buzzes off to rejoin Pippin, popping itself through the door. they drop Pippin a call to let him know they're heading out and they just hear him having an absolutely wild party time inside so they think he'll be okay. 
-
they enter the boat, gallion-style, and find pirate uniforms onboard. [[Maggie]] says they should raid the captain's quarters for cool maps and loot. [[Maggie]] and [[Lemm]] beg [[Giddyan]] to let them go through the captain's quarters but he's resistant, as captain. there's a crows nest, very tall, perfect place to put up a pride flag. 
-
by the wheel is a glass encased pure shard of Aether, cut beautifully in light blue. they take off into the air, the sky around them bleached yellow with the burning sunlight. None of them other than [[Lemm]] have been in the sky before, everything looks so small beneath them. the [[Troll'd Lake|troll-face lake]] far below, a beautiful scenery to look down on. 
-
[[Maggie]] is quite scared of heights and keeps to the center of the boat as it dips and oscillates. [[Maggie]] considers if they should have checked for anyone else on the boat before they took off. there's certainly space enough to build up a crew but those that were manning this ship were not on board when they took off. [[Maggie]] breaks a glass of pickles across the side to christen the boat the S.S. Bunch. as they cheer, [[Clarissa]] hears a little sound coming from her bag. looking on in fear, the rest of the party watch as [[Varian]] takes off his cloak and throws it over [[Clarissa]] who plops down with [[walnut]] on her shoulder to open up the beeping scroll. There she hears a voice, *''Operator 4S, this is your regularly scheduled report'*. [[Clarissa]] says she's on a boat, a different boat to last time. the voice says its a good thing she called in moments before, turns out there are more missing people than expected. they have gotten word some high profile individuals are being smuggled out, stay calm and remain where they are as a loud crash from a ship crashing into the side. massive chains with grappling hooks loop over their ship as they're descended upon. 
-
[[Varian]] goes on the defensive, staff out. the ship beside them is absolutely massive as [[Godseekers]] infest the S.S. Bunch, fighting off [[fey]] looking pirates as they're flung from the side of the ship. the chain ship assumes the S.S. Bunch is backup to help against the [[fey]] pirates they've been infested by. 
-
[[Clarissa]] notes the [[Godseekers]] look very different to the last time they saw them. [[Lemm]] sees on this boat as the captain takes a sword through the chest and is flung from the ship, right behind them a [[Godseekers]] not in the usual robed attire. their mask containing 3 bright Aether shards of some kind glow in the light around, a gas mask over their face and covered head to toe in riot gear. they're approaching a person that seems very familiar indeed. [[Lemm]] cant put their finger on WHY this person is familiar, though.
-
hefty spiders try and trample [[Lemm]] with their hefty weight, he manages to roll out of the way of a bit but doesn't manage to dodge a second smash attack as he's mildly highkey trampled
-
[[Venneer]]: they've finally caught him, they'll take him whether he likes it or not. the crew smuggling him out have basically been wiped out, they're trying desperately escape or been thrown overboard. an intimidating form in full riot gear, masked and with a massive weapon at hand, slowly approaches. [[Venneer|Venne]] firebolt - little mechanical firebugs. as [[Giddyan|Giddy]]  axes one of the spiders, shards of unfamiliar red crystal break off of it. [[Clarissa|Clari]] strikes at the chains with her mace, trying to limit how many can swarm their ship. it doesn't exactly break the chain but she notes they're rusted and definitely snappable, just a matter of how. 
-
[[Venneer|Venne]] sees a much smaller ship that the [[Godseekers]] are attacking, and a group of people very familiar.  [[Venneer|Venne]] makes a successful hit but they don't seem as bothered as they had hoped. 
-
[[Giddyan|Giddy]] tries to cast sleep on one of the fliers and watches as a purple glowing rune appears between the three eyes on the [[Godseekers]] mask nullifying the spell. Chromatic Orb (steel ball that the orb of damage bursts from)- acid. 24 to hit, 12 damaaaage. 
-
[[0.- Besties| The Besties]] aren't familiar with guns having not gone to [[Idyleshire]] but the flying bastards are holding sniper rifles that shoot Aether shards right at the spider and the spider begins to reanimate, with roughly half health as the crystal on its body slowly grows and takes over, letting out a horrific screech of pain. 
-
Misty step - stamps down and mist bursts from their heels, enveloping them and mistystepping. as they appear on the deck of the S.S. Bunch, The party recognizes them from [[Valeran]], when [[Daniel]] was taken. 
-
Fall is the only season in [[Halune]]. 
-
the ships crash into each other, and as one of the spiders approaches [[Maggie]] and [[Clarissa|Clari]], [[Clarissa|Clari]] notes it's being consumed by crystal, like a previous encounter where [[Maggie]] and [[Robert]] were being consumed by crystals. 
-
the very tall creature at [[Venneer|Venne's]] side with a staff, when [[Venneer|Venne's]] Chromatic orb just went a bit wide could tell the mask was loose, could be smacked off potentially. 
-
3, 6, 5, 4, 2, 2- magic missile twinned spell little ballbearings that burst wings and burst with force energy. 22 damage. 
-
35 damage - 13 = 22 absorb elements - the brocade sash across their chest is lined with absorbing tech. 

-
Wall of Fire 27 damage- coil of metal they whip across the floor
-
[[Varian]] cradles [[Lemm]], casts spare the dying and says in abyssal ([[Venneer|Venne]] understands) muttering, begging to someone, *'you can take anyone, but not him, my love*  (something else was referred to as his love) *please'* his prayer is heard and spare the dying settles in and [[Lemm]] is in the clear. 
-
[[Clarissa]] takes the mask off of big glaive bad guy and she sees underneath an [[Elezen]] coughing and bleeding out. She sits Dwayne the gargoyle on the [[Godseekers|Godseeker's]] chest like a cat, and then heals them. They frantically reach to their face and start cussing out the mask being taken. [[Clarissa]] recognises them, they dont have a name, they are an Executioner, the one the Operator said they would send, the Executioner they encountered in the Toxic Masculinity Catacombs. this is the girl that [[Clarissa]] saw have a bit of a meangirls breakdown. 
-
as she looks up at [[Clarissa]], she asks what she's doing here, trying to reach for her glaive. 'You're not 4S, who are you'. Remember, [[Clarissa]] got her out of Giovani's (sp???). In a panic, the Executioner tries to wiggle out from under Dwayne and smacks a button on the back of her wrist against the floor and a sharp beeping starts (EEEE MASK GONNA BLOOOWWW). Dwayne shields everyone from the blast and implodes the bomb against the Executioner. [[Varian]] shields [[Lemm]] from the residual fire. 
-
[[Venneer|Venne]] has to crane his neck to look up at [[Varian]]. silently they look down at them, cloak billowing in the wind.
-
The ship has been trashed by the [[Godseekers]], dead bodies of [[fey]] littered about. Looking around the galleon the ship belonged to [[fey]] pirates, a ship from [[Idyleshire]] stolen by a group of people in [[Valeran]]. 
-
[[Maggie]] asks if this ship was [[Venneer|Venne's]]. [[Lemm]] recognises them from [[York|Old York]], [[Giddyan|Giddy]], something about them, how they dress, reminds him of [[Daniel|The Developer]] a little bit, some kind scientist. [[Clarissa]],  Looking at this [[human]], this is definitely a scientist, one she recognises. the same scientist that put the soul crystal in Zak-IEL. 
-
These are the fuckers that destroyed his entire life's work destroying the presentation in [[York|Old York]], let the [[Daniel|developer]] get kidnapped, destroyed all the Aether Garrison he's been working on for years, let the [[Daniel|developer]] be kidnapped by a weird monkey and a white haired dude, and had to flee from [[York|Old York]] on a [[fey]] pirate ship because those weird people they've been contracted under for a while are after him for reasons he doesn't understand. 
-
these bitches destroyed the Aether Garrison, beat up the team that was supposed to pilot them and took the roughed up machines to [[Gillian|Gillian Burnam]] in [[Willowfey]]. 
-
[[Varian]] steps forward, with his staff looming over [[Venneer|Venne]] as they pace. [[Varian]] orders him inside, now. [[Venneer|Venne]] follows reluctantly because he's stuck on a fucking sky ship and has no other real choice. 
-
the others rifle through the pockets of the corpses as they go into the hull. [[Giddyan|Giddy]] stays above to pilot. we enter into a mess hall that's kept very nice. It's very [[Idyleshire|Idyleshirian]], that dwarven architecture vibe to it surrounded by carnage and they have a seat while [[Maggie]] rifles through corpses in the background. now safe from the light aspected Aether beaming from above. 
-
[[Clarissa]] asks what they're going to do about all this Aether. [[Varian]] opens his palm and there is the [[Ring of Judgement]]. Quietly he goes *'The father gave it to me before he left, it's only fitting to be in your hands i suppose, if you want'*. he knows this is a lot for her, she doesn't have to do this if she doesn't want. She tries to split the ring in two once more, yanking as hard as she can. It budges but it doesn't break in half. it's possible, but would take more than pulling. They can take it to [[Gillian|Prof. Gillian Burnam]]. she puts her sash through the ring and wears it on her belt. the only thing about splitting the ring she can recall is one thing that could split it, or at least one thing that could bring it together, perhaps the same thing can tear it apart. 
-
[[Venneer|Venne]] dresses very much in a combination of [[Dravania]]n styles and [[Idyleshire]]. 
-
[[Maggie]] tries to pull the pickles back and [[Venneer|Venne]] casts mage hand - tapping their rings together - and tries to pluck a pickle from the jar. she tosses a dagger at the Mage Hand, and intimidates. 
-
[[Varian]] is watching this, observing [[Venneer]] very carefully trying to analyse them. 
-
[[Venneer|Venne]] offers his name and asks theirs. [[Maggie]] asks [[Lemm]] if she can be rude now. 
-
[[Lemm]] introduced himself nicely. [[Maggie|Magpie]] introduces herself. 
-
[[Clarissa]] has been gathering more pickles and introduces herself.there's a tiny, adorable little spider on [[Clarissa]]'s shoulder named [[walnut]]. there's a small gold plated mask with 3 aether shard eyes - the same people that were trying to kidnap [[Venneer]]. He's not a threat, he's been compromised but it's something they're trying to work on. 
-
[[Venneer|Venne]] susses out the group, he's getting that [[Giddyan]] is a simpleminded person, [[Lemm]] very paranoid, [[Maggie]] unsure but they seem nice, [[Clarissa]] is someone so DONE with things right now, and [[Varian]] has NOT stopped staring at him across the room. this guy doesn't have a face, one eye and the other is bandaged through whispy white bangs. [[Venneer|V's]] never seen anything like this person before, its a little frightening but no malice behind him. [[Varian]] is def the babysitter of the group. he sees this group of goober and just thinks he's so fucked. these are the people who caused all that mayhem in [[York|Old York]]. 
-
Last time [[Maggie]] checked, humans don't flicker. the last [[human]] they had was the most boring motherfucker. this dude, however is such a 180, almost as if they're not [[human]]. 
-
[[Lemm]] offers [[Venneer| Venne]] a pickle in a peace offering. [[Maggie]] is glaring at [[Lemm]] for this. [[Giddyan|Giddy]] has been listening in on all of this through one of those funnel tubes. 
-
[[Giddyan|Giddy]] crawls through the vents and tries to brain [[Venneer|Venne]] with a pickle. startled, [[Venneer|Venne]] flickers a bit again. 
-
[[Maggie]] asks if [[Venneer|Venne]] likes dogs, he says yes but doesn't mean it cause he doesn't like any animals as they don't like him. [[Maggie]] is betrayed. [[Clarissa]] asks him what type of dogs he likes, and he asks if there's more than one. She wildshapes into the tiniest pomeranian and then shifts into a dog the size of the room. 
-
they discuss what they should inform [[Venneer|Venne]] of, and they were heading back towards [[Willowfey]]. Should they tell [[Gillian|Prof. Gillian Burnam]] about this mess, having a wanted fugitive on their boat. speaking of this boat, it's FAR too big to fit in [[Willowfey]]. 
-
Last [[Clarissa]] heard from [[Daniel]] before she left, [[Estinien]] wouldn't tell her if [[Daniel]] was okay rolls eyes. [[Venneer|Venne]] just hears these names tossed about so casually, secrets they guard so closely and is just absolutely BAFFLED that these weirdo mech destroyers know one of his most well kept secrets. 
-
[[Venneer|Venne]] asks about the [[York|Old York]] situation from their end. [[Varian]] *'You've seen my son, he was with you, do you know the name [[January|January Strider]]*'. [[Venneer|Venne]] remembers [[Daniel]] talking very fondly about a man that he was letting his Scientists be contracted to, so [[Venneer|Venne]] recalls as they were setting up in [[York|Old York]] there was a man with long white hair that carried himself with such prestige, accompanied by a very small capuchin monkey with dirk strider shades who seemed to carry a lot of teenage angst. this monkey, the man with the white hair would refer to as [[January|January Strider]], and every now and then would mention his plan to finally lure in [[Varian| The Vessel]]. V doesn't know what the vessel is. last recollection was [[January|January Strider]] destroying the stage of the garrison, attacking V and the soul crystal he was supposed to put in a mech, V shares that he sure was fine at the time. [[Varian]] sits back, arms crossed and goes silent when V shares this. 
-
[[Maggie]] pushes the jar of pickles towards [[Venneer]]and pulls [[Soup]] out. [[Soup]] is a little spotty mechanical puppy she places on top of the jar. 
-
[[Clarissa]] offers to play a song by Grandma, pulls out a a harp (its her literal grandma, it's just [[fey]] things). it's a lovely bonsai curled up with spiderwebs with dewdrops across the strings, a closed eyes smiling face. Grandma plays them a lovely song. The harp is set on the table and plays along. [[Giddyan|Giddy]] pulls out his instrument and plays along with it while driving with his feet. 
-
[[Clarissa|Clari]] knows [[Venneer|Venne]] is from [[Idyleshire]] and recalls their attitude to casters and their attitude to [[fey]]. 
-
[[Clarissa|Clari]] remembers seeing these kinds of supplies, in a little ship with [[Estinien]] there was a 'goldsmith' who worked with lots of bronze and copper and clockwork things, and some of the stuff they bought was very mechanical and similar to this. 
-
[[Giddyan|Giddy's]] father knew his way around technology, this stuff is trivial compared to the stuff the Cannons would get up to. He also recalls when [[Daniel|the developer]] talked about how he was the apprentice of [[Cannon Jonesy]], as if he were his replacement. and now [[Venneer]] coming up under [[Daniel|The Developer]]. feels weirdly like that's supposed to be his lineage. Also scoffs at the thought that this is the best it was going to get, he's definitely more skilled than [[Venneer]], good riddance to it. 
-
[[Willowfey]] is a small town in [[Willowfey|Lyrenvale]]. He's heard of feytowns existing in [[Halune]] and considering it's in the name its probably one of those. it's closer to [[Idyleshire]] than they currently are so he asks to tag along. He needs to go home and find out what the fuck happened to [[Daniel]]. 
-
[[Lemm]] gives [[Venneer|Venne]] a cup of tea and the other to [[Varian]]. 
-
A long while passes before they're able to see it get a little dark outside. Traveling for about 2 or 3 days they eventually reach [[Willowfey]] in their giant fuckin boat. They decide to park [[Dravania]]]] side, and they def don't look super threatening at all, [[Idyleshire]] boat in [[Dravania]]n territory, this is a great idea as they trundle into [[Willowfey]]. [[Clarissa|Clari]] tries to grow some vines over the sides of the boat with the help of [[Venneer|Venne]] to make it look like an abandoned pirate ship in a regular ass [[Dravania]]n path of Oxtail trail. It sticks out like a sore thumb but it mildly works, they shove it in some ferns. 
-
[[Venneer|Venne]] sticks parking ticket on the side of the S.S. Bunch. 
-
they walk into [[Willowfey]], doing the demon checks. they instantly look at [[Venneer]], put axe down. little whistle and a bunch of tiny pixies fly out and flitter around him. one pops up, a comedic large thumbs up and they're let through. The cool thing about [[Willowfey]], no roads, just river areas with gondolas, shrouded in willow trees. this is where Feyhouse is, the house ate the basement. 
-
This is where the game ends, we can do whatever silly shenanigans we want in [[Willowfey]]. every time they go home they get a long rest and infinite spells, in a perpetual long rest, this is a sanctuary space. For those that stay up after game etc they can continue in the rp chat, talk with NPCs and other people, all canon as long as Koi sees it. 
-
[[Venneer|Venne]] gets a [[0.- Besties|bestie]] bracelet (communication device) they lifted from [[Robert]]. Ye old whatsapp on here.
