# Dragoon
An Elezen man stands before a fierce dragon, it roars out and begins to take off in order to gain the advantage. With a massive leap the man lands atop the dragon and forces it back to the ground, creating an opening for his allies.

A Lalafelian cloaked in scale mail whirl's their spear around a cluster of enemies keeping them at bay. When the time is right they unleash a plume of fiery breath from beneath their helm, singing their targets.

A Firbolg woman runs and leaps high into the sky, magical wings forming on her body. With grace, she travels the currents of the wind, happily flying about as she exercises her new found freedom.

These fearless warriors stand against dragons, demons, fiends and any other threats who would raise a hand against their homelands. Dragoons use their command of both the sky and ground to strike down their foes with deadly strikes.

### Dragonbane
The Dragoon was a soldier born out of need in a distant land. Their homeland has been locked in a war against dragon kind for hundreds of years, leading to their soldiers to specialize in battling back against dragons. Their most notable ability is the Dragoon Jump, which is powered by a magical gem each Dragoon receives upon completing their basic training.

### Masters of the Sky
The Dragoons have been blessed with the ability to soar high into the air like those they have taken up arms to destroy. These warriors are able to crash down from the sky using their weapons and body weight to drive any skyborn into the ground, or cause great damage to those already on land. Wings will not grant you safety from a Dragoon.

### Dragoon's Trance
Beginning at the 1st level, you are able to fall into a special trance as a bonus action. Your soul is filled with power from your Dragoon forebears. While under the effects of this trance, your jump height becomes a minimum of 30ft. and your jump distance becomes a minimum of 15ft.

Your trance lasts for 1 minute. It ends early if you are knocked unconscious or you may end your trance as a bonus action. Some Dragoon abilities may cause your trance to end early. Once you have entered a trance a number of times shown for your dragoon level in the trances column for your dragoon table you must finish a long rest before you can enter a trance again.

### Jump
Also beginning at the 1st level, as an action you are able to perform a jump attack. Through the power of your Dragoon Trance you leap up to 30ft. into the air and land on a creature within 15ft. of your starting position. The creature makes a Dexterity saving throw against your Dive DC as calculated below, taking your weapon damage and bonus damage equal to 1d6 on a failure, and half as much on a success. This bonus damage is increased to 2d6 at the 5th level, 3d6 at the 11th level and 4d6 at the 18th level.

**Dive DC**Â = 8 + your proficiency modifier + your Strength modifier.

You may not use Jump on a creature who is higher than 30ft. nor does not have at least 5ft. of space above their head. After finishing your Jump, select an empty space adjacent to the target creature to land on. If the creature's size is Huge or larger, you may choose to attempt to land on the creature instead by making a Dexterity saving throw of a difficulty decided by the DM. You do not take fall damage as a result of using the Jump feature. Movement using the Jump feature does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

### Fighting Style
Beginning at the 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty, Choose one of the following options. You can't take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again.

#### Defense
While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.

#### Dueling
When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon.

#### Great Weapon Fighting
When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the twohanded or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.

#### Two-Weapon Fighting
When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack.

### Lancet
Also beginning at 2nd level, while under the effects of Dragoon's Trance, as an action you may make a melee weapon attack that drains your target's vitality. You recover hit points equal to half the damage of your weapon attack rounded up. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier (a minimum of once). You regain any expended uses when you finish a short rest.
