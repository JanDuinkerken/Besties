# 5.- Artifacts
The [[0.- Besties|besties]] were tasked by [[Gillian]] with finding and bringing him different Relics scattered around [[Halune]], before the [[Godseekers]] can get to them and destroy them. 

## Relic Classifications
There are three ways the F.A.C works to classify relics.

### First Class Relics
A first class relic is a body part of a deity, such as a soul crystal, or the deities' blood, bone, or flesh.

According to the [[0.- Besties|Bestie]]'s discoveries, the relics that you are working to protect contain Soul Crystals. A Soul Crystal is a piece of heavily concentrated Aether; aka, a piece of the Deity themselves.

### Second Class Relics
Second class relics are possessions that a deity owned, such as a rosary, a piece of cloth, or an item they kept in close possession.

### Third Class Relics
Third class relics are objects that have been touched to a first or second class relic or the deity has touched themselves. This can be any common item, though the deities' touch much be carefully examined to be proven a third class relic.
