Giddyan Flintheart {.Davek}

## Description
Mountain [[Dwarves|Dwarf]],  around 5ft tall. Brown hair and eyes. Wears lots of brown, black or grey. Chaotic neutral.

In terms of personality, he is not someone who fully trusts other people from the start. He is friendly and likes meeting people and making new friends because he doesn’t know many people, but he wont really tell you much about himself until he finds you trusty enough.

Having lived with [[giants]](while he is only 5ft tall) there’s not much he fears, and that makes him love adventuring and the thrill of finding and learning about new powerful beings or dangerous plants, animals, or Enemies. He also enjoys traveling and finding new cities and learning about different cultures or races.

## Backstory
He was born in a small mountain town named Salmyr, in [[The Highlands]], far from most big cities. When he was little his village got raided by a group of bandits, but he managed to escape.

Wandering through the mountains he met a giant named Tharn. He was scared at first, but after being roaming the mountains for a long time without almost any food or water he approached him to ask for help.

To his surprise Tharn was an outcast from a giant group, exiled because he pursued knowledge from the runes instead of mindless fighting. Under his wing Giddyan learnt to utilize the runes and harvest their power. After training and living with him for some years he decided that it was time to seek revenge for his family and to reclaim his village, but first he would need help, so he chose to embark on an adventure to find friends and connections and to become powerful enough to defeat those bandits.
