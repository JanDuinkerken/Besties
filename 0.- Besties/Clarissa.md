## Backstory
### Childhood
Clarissa Viridi, sometimes called “Clairy” from those she gets close with. She is technically the eldest of 3 in a household of 4. She lived with her mother, [[Charlotte]] Viridi, and her sisters, [[Clarabelle]] (21) and [[Claudia]] (19) Viridi. Her father had not been present in her life for he fell to the Calamity (Found out via [[Winona]]’s Speak to Plants). The [[Solus]]’ Church of [[Ortus]] took pity on the kind mother [[Charlotte]] and offered assistance and promise of a kind childhood in exchange for a devout child. It was a strange offer but [[Charlotte]] agreed for the sake of the future of her three daughters.

### Religious upbringing
She has earned the little nickname of “[[Ortus]]’ Light” within the church of [[Ortus]], [[Gods|God]] of the sun and healing, which she regularly attended and devoted herself to in the city of. Though Claire would be sent out to run errands with her sisters every now and then, she would frequent at the [[Solus]]’ church of [[Ortus]], [[Solus]]’ Southern schoolhouse (at older ages, as a tutor), and a neighboring city’s, Valerian’s, library. She would read and learn about other religions and other magics. (Though she had been advised to stay away from [[Valeran]]). [[Ortus]], the [[Gods|god]] of the Sun’s warmth and light and is focused on being kind and helpful to all but to not overwork yourself– there is a common saying among the church that the priest uses to close all sermons– “Be careful, Rays of [[Ortus]], though His light in us burns brightly, we shouldn't allow ourselves to burn out nor dim.” At this time (which is roughly the age of 12-20), Claire truly felt a part of the community, getting to talk with everyone, learning everything about all the people who felt comfortable enough to talk to her about anything. She soon became the ear that leans to all. Though she became beloved by most, she’d know how people gossip, she’d know how everyone is in some sort of pain. She didn’t know she had been slowly burning herself out being the light everyone used when there were dark times. Clarissa had a rather tame, but a little paranoid upbringing. In a well-knit community, she doesn't really know the dangers of strangers, but rather the dangers of having to keep secrets-- where she grew up, there are no secrets, it takes one person to know for the rest to soon follow.
