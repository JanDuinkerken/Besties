# Bo Burnham
[[Gillian]]'s brother. 

He is a [[human]].

He gave [[Lemm]] and [[Briss]] their first mission, transporting a totally-not-stolen supply cart down the road to the nearby town of [[Willowfey]]. 

It turns out he was a [[Godseekers|Godseeker]], when the party found out they fought and killed him.
