# Devendra Montague
Devendra Montague is a 21 year old [[human]], 5'7'' with pale skin with freckles and red hair.

She has a noteable lightning scar that goes down her forehead and over her right eye.

She grew up in the town of [[Solus]], Hunaecove. 

She has an older brother named [[Daniel]] Montague, who had given Devendra her scar due to an accident in the past. 

Because of said accident, Devendra had been unable to cast magic her whole life, causing her mother and father to never be content with her. Devendra had been trying every method possible to cast magic, from worshipping [[Ortus]], and travelled all the way to [[Dravania]] to try and become a wizard. 

Devendra had an encounter with the [[Godseekers]] whilst travelling with Ser [[Levian]] ([[Levi]]) to a cave in [[Dravania]]. Devendra had been willing to join with the promise of not needing deities to bless her with magic abilities. 

After encountering the [[0.- Besties|besties]] in the caves the [[Godseekers]] had inhabited, Devendra had been subdued. Devendra would later join the party after being healed by Dravanian Scholars. Devendra accompanied the [[0.- Besties|besties]] throughout their trial investigation and after.

After the [[0.- Besties|besties]] had acquired the Ring Of Ideals from [[Mother Moth]], Devendra had been trusted to hold it.

Once the [[0.- Besties|besties]] had acquired the Ring of Truth, Devendra had taken it, combining them with the help of the [[Moondog]], Devendra had the [[Ring of Judgement]] in her hands. With her desperation for casting magic, she wore the ring, forcing herself to become a vessel of [[Kwoh]]. 

Devendra had died by getting shattered after being stabbed by a red knife [[January]] had.

There was implied Mayonnaise between Devendra and [[Clarissa]] Viridi
