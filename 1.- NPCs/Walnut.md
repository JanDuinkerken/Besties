# Walnut
Walnut, a very tiny spider with a gold mask (sometimes), is a scribe for the [[Godseekers]], they have a rather mischevious and nosey personality but they are very cute so it makes everything they do endearing. They had been sent to [[Clarissa]] by [[Estinien]], being the messenger between the two. [[Clarissa]] grew fondly for Walnut, making sure they do not get hurt, and even moreso once she had learned to speak with animals. When [[Clarissa]] visited the abandoned Jovanni Theatre, Walnut's mask broke off due to [[Robert]] reflecting a spell and said spell convieniently hitting Walnut. After [[Clarissa]]'s visit to Idleshyre, Walnut returns with their new mask practically glued to their face, causing them panic and harm (?).
