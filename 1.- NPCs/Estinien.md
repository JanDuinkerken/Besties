A noteable trait he wears one dangly silver earring on the gay side and has very shiny golden eyes.

On Estinien's 7th birthday, his mother failed to win a game against his father, leading to Juliana having to follow him to the [[feywild]], but Estinien had been willing to take her place instead. In which after Estinien had been taken to the [[feywild]], he had been sent to be under Jovanni's Theatre. Growing up in the TOXIC MASCULINITY CATACOMBSSS, Estinien had adapted and was basically the top dog by the time he was like 17. 

When Estinien was 18, he had been sent out to the material plane to perform and assassinate nobles in [[York]]. During the performance, he encountered [[January]] Strider and [[Kyros]] [[Varian]] for the first time, botching up the final (?) targets-- the King and Queen of [[York]]. Cause of this, Estinien found himself trapped in [[York]]. Thus, beginning his chase for the two knuckle heads.
