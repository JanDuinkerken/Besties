# Clarabelle Viridi
Clarabelle Viridi is a 21 year old Fauna [[Fey]]. She is 5'3 with brown hair usually in a ponytail and tan skin with white freckles.

Growing up in [[Solus]], Hunaecove, Clarabelle is technically the middle child to [[Charlotte]] Viridi. Clarabelle often dissolves disputes between the eldest, her older twin [[Clarissa]] Viridi, and the youngest child, [[Claudia]] Viridi. Clarabelle is shown to be quiet and attentive. 

Clarabelle is known to have relations with [[Calliope]], as she had been said to have been making trips to Crescentvale in the Astrazalin Empire. Sometime before the [[0.- Besties|besties]] arrived to [[Solus]], Clarabelle had been invited to be apart of the [[Godseekers]], being gifted a mask by [[Estinien]], she held onto the mask, claiming she will "think about it".
