# Archbishop Soren XVII
[[Levi]]'s father.

He was the "ruler" of [[New Dravania]], until the besties discovered his plan of becoming the next succesor to [[Ravan]] and stoped him, killing him in the process.

He gave the inhabitants of [[New Dravania]] the blood of [[Ravan]], who he had restrained and weakened, turning them from Western [[Elezen]] to Dravanians.
