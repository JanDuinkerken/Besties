# Nymphs
## Wild Personality

The personality of a nymph is also a reflection of nature. Nymphs are mercurial creatures who may act with kindness but are also quick to strike against those who tread on nature by acting greedily or thoughtlessly. As caretakers of the woods, they favor deep forests and often shun the other races. However, due to their playfulness, curiosity and carefree nature, the strongly individual nymph can be found all over supporting a wide variety of different causes.

## Embodiment of Nature
Nymphs, unless they choose to do so, do not reproduce, but are rather generated by the beauty of the natural world. The beauty of a nymph is so difficult for the mind to comprehend that the brain of an onlooker often simply stops processing visual stimuli to avoid sensory overload. Nymphs are not merely reflections of their environment but are intimately intertwined with it. If the home of a nymph is burned, used as a dumping ground, or otherwise despoiled, the nymph may fade away or become twisted. Similarly, if a nymph is injured, the beauty of the surroundings is likewise diminished, and if a nymph is killed, the area will become twisted and wither.

## Sacred Places
Although the nymph may embody a forest or some larger aspect of nature, a nymph's home is a particularly secluded and pristine area, such as a grove, a pool, or a hilltop. Nymphs will defend this area against all intrusion. Nymphs will often use non-lethal force at first unless given reason to believe the intruders have ill-intent or if they reply with deadly attacks of their own.

Friends of nature, such as druids or rangers, may be given an opportunity to explain their presence, and if there is a good reason, maybe offered aid.
