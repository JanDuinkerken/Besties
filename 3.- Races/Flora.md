This race is mainly classified between being edible or non-edible by the majority of the surrounding population. If the [[fey]] is found to be edible, they are generally called "Sylphs."

Sylphs, compared to their other typical flowering cousins, tend to have more vegetable and fruit features, such as daikon raddishes or cabbages.

## History
Flora are a population originating exclusively within the [[feywild]]. It is rare to see them venture outside of they [[feywild]] due to [[Halune]]'s recent conditions. Flora are generally known as a tenacious and hardy folk, which is why they have somehow remained the [[fey]] race with the highest population despite their relative lack of special abilities or skills. Perhaps it is through their teamwork and ability to stand back up that they have been so successful.

## Society
Flora are vagrant people who venture where the wind takes them. They lack a familial sense, living their lives in complete hedonism. They have no classification system or ranking between themselves.
