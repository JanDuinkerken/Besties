The Lalafell are generally a cheery race of people. Long ago the Lalafells lived as masters of agriculture and spread across the land along trade routes, selling their produce becoming one of the most widespread races there is. In time the Dunesfolk went as far as establishing their own desert city-state known as Adlenbard. These tiny folk are highly ambitious and are not afraid to take hold of opportunity when it appears before them.

## Tiny Yet Mighty
Lalafell anatomy sees these kindly people rarely growing to be 3 feet tall. Their short bodies are rotund, with short stubby looking legs. But appearances can be deceiving as Lalafells bodies are highly efficient, allowing them to travel long distances on their short legs. The Plainsfolk have larger, pointed ears which greatly improved their hearing, while the Dunesfolk developed a film which covers their eyes, protecting them from the sun and sand of the desert. Additionally, out of tradition, Dunesfolk sometimes place gemstones associated with their zodiac on their foreheads.

## Products of the Land
The Lalafellin homelands produced two types of people, from which they take their names. 
The Plainsfolk started off as agriculturalists living their lives on their farms, eventually trading their goods across the land, leading for lalafells to spread across the world. The Dunesfolk began and remain as desert dwelling folk, their bodies adapting to the harsh conditions.

## Rolling Planes and Towering Dunes
The Lalafell can trace their ancestry back to two key area. 
The Plainsfolk began as farmers on fertile lands across the southern seas, farming the fertile lands of their namesake. 
The Dunesfolk were not so lucky to have farmable land and instead turned to animal husbandry. Traditionally Dunesfolk built their homes on the backs of beasts of burden, traveling with their herds. Eventually the Dunesfolk founded a great city of wealth, where many Dunesfolk live today.

## Family and Fortune
Lalafells care deeply for their small families and would do anything for them. They may set out on an adventure to support their families or in their defense. Not all Lalafells have such pure goals though as many contain a great deal of ambition in their tiny bodies. Merchants travel all over the land, researchers seeking knowledge in secret places, sellswords bravely take on jobs to prove themselves. Lalafells may be small, but they take on the world in a big way.
