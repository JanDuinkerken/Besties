# Apeling
## Monkey See, Monkey Do
Apelings are a fusion of humanoid and monkey traits. This relation is evident in their fur, tails, fangs, and other traits. However, their intelligence, smaller size, and more bipedal posture suggest some closeness to mankind. 

Apelings are slightly smaller than humans but are still medium. They usually have more defined muscles than monkeys, though they are still rather slender, keeping a very athletic appearance. Fur colors include black, brown, red, orange, and grey. White fur is usually a "sign" of inherent greatness. 

Apelings age fast, reaching full adulthood in only 12 years. Although apelings only have a slightly longer lifespan than humans, their active nature and lifestyle mean they burn through their years faster than a [[human]], putting their average lifespan at 70 years. Despite aging fast, apelings do not feel the usual effects of old age until months before their death, many still adventuring within the last year of their life.
