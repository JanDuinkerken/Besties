# Tiefling
## Draconic Bloodline
Tieflings are derived from [[Elezen]] bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look [[human]]. However, their Draconic heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle’s, and some spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns. They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of [[human]] coloration, but also include various shades of the rainbow Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.

## Self-Reliant and Suspicious
Tieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in [[human]] cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.

Lacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life.
