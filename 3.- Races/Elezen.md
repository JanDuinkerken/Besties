[[3.- Races]]
# Elezen
## Elegance and Pride
Long legs, slender bodies, pointed ears and sharp features are all marks of an Elezen. Only rivaling their otherworld appearance is the poise with which they carry themselves. Their tall, thin frames only differ within the race by the colour of their skin.

The Elezen are a race divided within themselves, and their often arrogant attitudes keep the other races at an arms reach. 
The Western Elezen live off the lush Highlands, using their keen ears to hunt in the dense woods. The Eastern Elezen in contrast are notorious for thievery and pillaging, being the victims of prejudice within their Western cousins.

The Elezen race is divided into three subgroups due to their pride. The Western and Eastern found they could not coexist and distanced themselves from one another, with the Western believing they are the true rulers of [[The Highlands]] in which they live and hold dominion. While the Dravanians live as a separate group of Elezen who founded a city state in the North and have a totally unique culture of their own, closed off from the rest of the world.

## Western Heritage
The Western Elezen have become the self-procilaimed protectors of [[The Highlands]] and masters of war and progress. Despite this, the Western Elezen keep a tight hold on their homes, defending them aggressively. Years of life in [[The Highlands]] has imbued them with various abilities, such as tall pointed ears to better hear their surroundings. Though newer generations find themselves to be much more weaker and pampered in comparison to their age-old ancestors. Living in the Northwestern reigions of [[Halune]] have made their distinct ear-shape and paler features easily recognizable.

## Eastern Heritage
Eastern Elezen whose ancestors made their home in the feytouched plains of the Southeastern portions of [[Halune]]. Their vibrant hair and diverse skin sets them apart from the Western Elezen and marks them to stand out. Eastern Elezen are natural explorers after their forefathers, adapting to the shores of Hollyhill and [[Hanae Cove]]. The difficulty fitting into Idylshirian society lead the Eastern Elezen to build a reputation of banditry for themselves.


## Dravanian Heritage
Looking to the Northern city state of [[New Dravania]], towering spires, homes and a grand cathedral hide behind their giant gates. Living conditions in [[Dravania]] are rough, as the poor go hungry in the lower levels of the city, while the wealthy live in exuberance, looking down on the less fortunate citizens, ruled by the religious teachings of the Holy See.
Originally Western Elezen in nature, Dravanians gained their Draconic features due to drinking the blood of [[Ravan]], a Pure-[[Dragon]] God who had been weakened and kept stored within the center of [[Archbishop]] Soren XVII's Cathedral. Dravanians are characterized by their curved horns and intricate patterning of scales across their bodies. Sleek and powerful tails extend out from behind them. Their faces contain sharp features and piercing eyes.

Dravanians are a misunderstood people due to their physical appearance. Their scaled bodies and horns led many to fear them, believing them to be descendants of dragons or demons. This fear led to hate, which gave way to violence, leaving these proud people fewer in number across much of the world beyond [[Dravania]] itself. These conditions have led these Draconic Elezen to value their families beyond all else.
